	Abstract = {Motivation: Biological reality can in silico only be comprehensively represented in multi-scaled models. To this end, cell behavioural models addressing the multi-cellular level have to be semantically linked with mechanistic molecular models. These requirements have to be met by flexible software workflows solving the issues of different time scales, inter-model variable referencing and flexible sub-model embedding.

RESULTS: We developed a novel software workflow (EPISIM) for the semantic integration of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)-based quantitative models in multi-scaled tissue models and simulations. This workflow allows to import and access SBML-based models. SBML model species, reactions and parameters are semantically integrated in cell behavioural models (CBM) represented by graphical process diagrams. By this, cellular states like proliferation and differentiation can be flexibly linked to gene-regulatory or biochemical reaction networks. For a multi-scale agent-based tissue simulation executable code is automatically generated where different time scales of imported SBML models and CBM have been mapped. We demonstrate the capabilities of the novel software workflow by integrating Tyson's cell cycle model in our model of human epidermal tissue homeostasis. Finally, we show the semantic interplay of the different biological scales during tissue simulation.

AVAILABILITY: The EPISIM platform is available as binary executables for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X at http://www.tiga.uni-hd.de. Supplementary data are available at http://www.tiga.uni-hd.de/supplements/SemSBMLIntegration.html.},

@article{MiramsArt2013,
	Abstract = {Chaste --- Cancer, Heart And Soft Tissue Environment --- is an open source C++ library for the computational simulation of mathematical models developed for physiology and biology. Code development has been driven by two initial applications: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cell-based simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to `re-invent the wheel' with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications. Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular test-driven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability. In this article we provide examples that illustrate the types of problems Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a desktop computer. We highlight some scientific studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the insights they have provided. The source code, both for specific releases and the development version, is available to download under an open source Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licence at http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste, together with details of a mailing list and links to documentation and tutorials.},

	Abstract = {The study of how cells interact to produce tissue development, homeostasis, or diseases was, until recently, almost purely experimental. Now, multi-cell computer simulation methods, ranging from relatively simple cellular automata to complex immersed-boundary and finite-element mechanistic models, allow in silico study of multi-cell phenomena at the tissue scale based on biologically observed cell behaviors and interactions such as movement, adhesion, growth, death, mitosis, secretion of chemicals, chemotaxis, etc. This tutorial introduces the lattice-based Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg (GGH) Monte Carlo multi-cell modeling and the open-source GGH-based CompuCell3D simulation environment that allows rapid and intuitive modeling and simulation of cellular and multi-cellular behaviors in the context of tissue formation and subsequent dynamics. We also present a walkthrough of four biological models and their associated simulations that demonstrate the capabilities of the GGH and CompuCell3D.},

@article{RichmondWal2010,
	Abstract = {Driven by the availability of experimental data and ability to simulate a biological scale which is of immediate interest, the cellular scale is fast emerging as an ideal candidate for middle-out modelling. As with `bottom-up' simulation approaches, cellular level simulations demand a high degree of computational power, which in large-scale simulations can only be achieved through parallel computing. The flexible large-scale agent modelling environment (FLAME) is a template driven framework for agent-based modelling (ABM) on parallel architectures ideally suited to the simulation of cellular systems. It is available for both high performance computing clusters (www.flame.ac.uk) and GPU hardware (www.flamegpu.com) and uses a formal specification technique that acts as a universal modelling format. This not only creates an abstraction from the underlying hardware architectures, but avoids the steep learning curve associated with programming them. In benchmarking tests and simulations of advanced cellular systems, FLAME GPU has reported massive improvement in performance over more traditional ABM frameworks. This allows the time spent in the development and testing stages of modelling to be drastically reduced and creates the possibility of real-time visualisation for simple visual face-validation.},

	Abstract = {Despite their increasing popularity, agent-based models are hard to test, and so far no established testing technique has been devised for this kind of software applications. Reverse engineering an agent-based model specification from model simulations can help establish a confidence level about the implemented model and in some cases reveal discrepancies between observed and normal or expected behaviour. In this study, a multiobjective optimisation technique based on a simple random search algorithm is deployed to dynamically infer and refine the specification of three agent-based models from their simulations. The multiobjective optimisation technique also incorporates a dynamic invariant detection technique which serves to guide the search towards uncovering new model behaviour that better captures the model specification. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was also deployed to replace the random search algorithm, and the results from both approaches were compared. While both algorithms revealed good potential in capturing the model specifications, the pure exploratory nature of random search was found more suitable for the application at hand, compared to the balanced exploitation/exploration nature of genetic algorithms in general.},

@article{KarrWil2015,
	Abstract = {Whole-cell models that explicitly represent all cellular components at the molecular level have the potential to predict phenotype from genotype. However, even for simple bacteria, whole-cell models will contain thousands of parameters, many of which are poorly charac- terized or unknown. New algorithms are needed to estimate these parameters and enable researchers to build increasingly comprehensive models. We organized the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) 8 Whole-Cell Parameter Esti- mation Challenge to develop new parameter estimation algorithms for whole-cell models. We asked participants to identify a subset of parameters of a whole-cell model given the model's structure and in silico ``experimental'' data. Here we describe the challenge, the best performing methods, and new insights into the identifiability of whole-cell models. We also describe several valuable lessons we learned toward improving future challenges. Going forward, we believe that collaborative efforts supported by inexpensive cloud com- puting have the potential to solve whole-cell model parameter estimation.},

	Abstract = {Single-cell and single-molecule measurements indicate the importance of stochastic phenomena in cell biology. Stochasticity creates spontaneous differences in the copy numbers of key macromolecules and the timing of reaction events between genetically-identical cells. Mathematical models are indispensable for the study of phenotypic stochasticity in cellular decision-making and cell survival. There is a demand for versatile, stochastic modeling environments with extensive, preprogrammed statistics functions and plotting capabilities that hide the mathematics from the novice users and offers low-level programming access to the experienced user. Here we present StochPy (Stochastic modeling in Python), which is a flexible software tool for stochastic simulation in cell biology. It provides various stochastic simulation algorithms, SBML support, analyses of the probability distributions of molecule copy numbers and event waiting times, analyses of stochastic time series, and a range of additional statistical functions and plotting facilities for stochastic simulations. We illustrate the functionality of StochPy with stochastic models of gene expression, cell division, and single-molecule enzyme kinetics. StochPy has been successfully tested against the SBML stochastic test suite, passing all tests. StochPy is a comprehensive software package for stochastic simulation of the molecular control networks of living cells. It allows novice and experienced users to study stochastic phenomena in cell biology. The integration with other Python software makes StochPy both a user-friendly and easily extendible simulation tool.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) are used clinically for treating cancer-related anemia. Recent clinical trials have reported increased adverse events and reduced survival in ESA-treated breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, potentially related to erythropoietin (EPO)-induced cancer progression. However, minimal preclinical data are available about the impact of EPO on metastatic cell behavior and/or the metastatic process, and this was the goal of our study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Breast cancer cell lines were treated with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) and screened for expression of EPO receptors (EPOR). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines were used for functional assays in vitro (two-dimensional/three-dimensional growth and survival) and in vivo (tumorigenicity and metastasis), in the presence or absence of EPO and/or cytotoxic agents. RESULTS: A large variation in EPOR expression across cell lines was observed. In vitro, rHuEPO had a protective effect on radiation-treated MDA-MB-435 cells (P < 0.05); however, rHuEPO treatment alone or combined with chemotherapy or hypoxia did not influence cell survival. In vivo, rHuEPO increased lung metastases in immunocompromised mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435 cells and treated with chemotherapy relative to mice treated with chemotherapy alone (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of an in vitro effect of rHuEPO highlights the importance of in vivo studies to delineate the effects of EPO on the metastatic process. These studies may begin to uncover the underlying functional explanation for the observed EPO-related adverse events and decreased survival in ESA-treated metastatic breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 2011 AACR},

@article{Grima2012,
	Abstract = {Moment-closure approximations have in recent years become a popular means to estimate the mean concentrations and the variances and covariances of the concentration fluctuations of species involved in stochastic chemical reactions, such as those inside cells. The typical assumption behind these methods is that all cumulants of the probability distribution function solution of the chemical master equation which are higher than a certain order are negligibly small and hence can be set to zero. These approximations are ad hoc and hence the reliability of the predictions of these class of methods is presently unclear. In this article, we study the accuracy of the two moment approximation (2MA) (third and higher order cumulants are zero) and of the three moment approximation (3MA) (fourth and higher order cumulants are zero) for chemical systems which are monostable and composed of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. We use the system-size expansion, a systematic method of solving the chemical master equation for monostable reaction systems, to calculate in the limit of large reaction volumes, the first- and second-order corrections to the mean concentration prediction of the rate equations and the first-order correction to the variance and covariance predictions of the linear-noise approximation. We also compute these corrections using the 2MA and the 3MA. Comparison of the latter results with those of the system-size expansion shows that: (i) the 2MA accurately captures the first-order correction to the rate equations but its first-order correction to the linear-noise approximation exhibits the wrong dependence on the rate constants. (ii) the 3MA accurately captures the first- and second-order corrections to the rate equation predictions and the first-order correction to the linear-noise approximation. Hence while both the 2MA and the 3MA are more accurate than the rate equations, only the 3MA is more accurate than the linear-noise approximation across all of parameter space. The analytical results are numerically validated for dimerization and enzyme-catalyzed reactions.},

These systems can be described as Markov processes and are modelled using the Chemical Master Equation (CME). The CME is a differential-difference equation (continuous in time and discrete in the state space) for the probability of certain state at a given time. The state space is the population count of species in the system. A successful method for computing the CME is the Finite State Projection Method (FSP). In this paper we will give the mathematical background of the FSP and propose a new addition to the FSP which guaranties our approximation to have optimal order.},

@article{AleKir2013,
	Abstract = {Moment approximation methods are gaining increasing attention for their use in the approximation of the stochastic kinetics of chemical reaction systems. In this paper we derive a general moment expansion method for any type of propensities and which allows expansion up to any number of moments. For some chemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the dynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation is unable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have a strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give information about higher order moments of the underlying probability distribution. We demonstrate the method using a dimerisation reaction, Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a model of an oscillating p53 system. We show that for the dimerisation reaction and Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics system higher order moments have limited influence on the estimation of the mean, while for the p53 system, the solution for the mean can require several moments to converge to the average obtained from many stochastic simulations. We also find that agreement between lower order moments does not guarantee that higher moments will agree. Compared to stochastic simulations, our approach is numerically highly efficient at capturing the behaviour of stochastic systems in terms of the average and higher moments, and we provide expressions for the computational cost for different system sizes and orders of approximation. We show how the moment expansion method can be employed to efficiently quantify parameter sensitivity. Finally we investigate the effects of using too few moments on parameter estimation, and provide guidance on how to estimate if the distribution can be accurately approximated using only a few moments.},

@article{SpivakGas2009,
	Abstract = {Anemia is frequent in cancer patients and its incidence increases with chemotherapy. The probability of requiring transfusions also increases with chemotherapy. Anemia negatively impacts survival and accentuates fatigue in cancer patients. Cancer promotes inflammatory cytokine production, which suppresses erythropoiesis and erythropoietin (EPO) production. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) improve erythropoiesis and reduce transfusion needs in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However, meta-analyses have shown an increased risk of thromboembolic (TE) events with ESA use during chemotherapy, but not increased on-study mortality or reduced overall survival. Three reasons have been proposed to explain why ESAs might have adverse effects in anemic cancer patients: tumor progression due to stimulation of tumor cell EPO receptors; increased risk of TE; and reduced survival. However, erythropoietin is not an oncogene, nor is the EPO receptor. It has also been demonstrated that erythropoietin does not stimulate tumor proliferation. Increased TE risk associated with ESAs is probably a consequence of increased blood viscosity due to excessive RBC mass elevation with concomitant plasma volume contraction, nitric oxide scavenging, and endothelial cell activation. Increased ESA dosing may also impact survival negatively because EPO contracts the plasma volume and stimulates inflammatory cytokine production independently of increasing erythropoiesis. Furthermore, transfusions themselves are associated with an increase in TE and plasma volume contraction, and these events are potentiated when ESAs are given with transfusions. An update on the management of anemia in oncology, the potential adverse events of ESAs, the benefits and risks of transfusions, and QoL are discussed in this paper.},

	Abstract = {The conventional approach to parametric model fitting of time series is realized through the comparison of various competing models by some ad hoc criterion. Since each of the models is  usually specified by the parameters determined by the information from the data, the extension of the classical concept of likelihood to this situation is not obvious. By asking the loglikelihood of a model to be an unbiased estimate of the expected log likelihood of the model, a reasonable definition of the likelihood is obtained and this allows us to develop a systematic approach to parametric time series modelling. Practical utility of this approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.},

	Abstract = {Background
Dynamic modelling is one of the cornerstones of systems biology. Many research efforts are currently being invested in the development and exploitation of large-scale kinetic models. The associated problems of parameter estimation (model calibration) and optimal experimental design are particularly challenging. The community has already developed many methods and software packages which aim to facilitate these tasks. However, there is a lack of suitable benchmark problems which allow a fair and systematic evaluation and comparison of these contributions.

Results
Here we present BioPreDyn-bench, a set of challenging parameter estimation problems which aspire to serve as reference test cases in this area. This set comprises six problems including medium and large-scale kinetic models of the bacterium E. coli, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, the vinegar fly D. melanogaster, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, and a generic signal transduction network. The level of description includes metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, and development. For each problem we provide (i) a basic description and formulation, (ii) implementations ready-to-run in several formats, (iii) computational results obtained with specific solvers, (iv) a basic analysis and interpretation.

Conclusions
This suite of benchmark problems can be readily used to evaluate and compare parameter estimation methods. Further, it can also be used to build test problems for sensitivity and identifiability analysis, model reduction and optimal experimental design methods. The suite, including codes and documentation, can be freely downloaded from the BioPreDyn-bench website, https://sites.google.com/site/biopredynbenchmarks/ webcite.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how dynamic molecular networks affect whole-organism physiology, analogous to mapping genotype to phenotype, remains a key challenge in biology. Quantitative models that represent processes at multiple scales and link understanding from several research domains can help to tackle this problem. Such integrated models are more common in crop science and ecophysiology than in the research communities that elucidate molecular networks. Several laboratories have modeled particular aspects of growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, but it was unclear whether these existing models could productively be combined. We test this approach by constructing a multiscale model of Arabidopsis rosette growth. Four existing models were integrated with minimal parameter modification (leaf water content and one flowering parameter used measured data). The resulting framework model links genetic regulation and biochemical dynamics to events at the organ and whole-plant levels, helping to understand the combined effects of endogenous and environmental regulators on Arabidopsis growth. The framework model was validated and tested with metabolic, physiological, and biomass data from two laboratories, for five photoperiods, three accessions, and a transgenic line, highlighting the plasticity of plant growth strategies. The model was extended to include stochastic development. Model simulations gave insight into the developmental control of leaf production and provided a quantitative explanation for the pleiotropic developmental phenotype caused by overexpression of miR156, which was an open question. Modular, multiscale models, assembling knowledge from systems biology to ecophysiology, will help to understand and to engineer plant behavior from the genome to the field.},

	Abstract = {A bias correction to the Akaike information criterion, AIC, is derived for regression and autoregressive time series models. The correction is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed.},

@book{BurnhamAmd2002,
	Abstract = {We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research workers in various scientific disciplines to the use of information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a ``best'' model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-depened set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (multimodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight essential expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the flow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. Second, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the first edition.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian model selection using Bayes factors requires the computation of marginal likelihoods. Nowadays, the marginal likelihoods are often computed using thermo- dynamic integration for power posteriors, which relies on numerical integration methods. The commonly used integra- tion methods however neither control the integration accu- racy nor exploit the available function evaluations efficiently. In this manuscript we introduce an adaptive method for cal- culating marginal likelihoods which relies on Simpson's rule. The proposed method is evaluated on an analytically tractable academic example as well as two high-dimensional mod- els possessing up to 800 parameters. The high-dimensional models describe the protein degradation in a large popula- tion of fibroblast cells. Our analysis reveals that the proposed adaptive method shows improved performance over existing approaches for simple problems and furthermore allows for the efficient study of high-dimensional problems.},

@inproceedings{DauphinPas2014,
	Abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.

	Abstract = {The therapeutic activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibody cetuximab in gastric cancer is currently being investigated in clinical studies. Reliable biomarkers for the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from this treatment are not available. In this study, we assessed the activity of cetuximab in five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, AZ521, Hs746T, LMSU and MKN1). The viability of two of these cell lines, AZ521 and MKN1, was significantly reduced by cetuximab treatment. High expression and secretion levels of the EGFR-binding ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), were associated with cetuximab responsiveness. MET activation and mutations in Kirsten-Ras gene (KRAS) were associated with cetuximab resistance. By introducing a hierarchy between these markers, we established a model that facilitated the correct classification of all five gastric cancer cell lines as cetuximab responsive or non-responsive. The highest priority was allocated to activating KRAS mutations, followed by MET activation and finally by the levels of secreted AREG. In order to validate these results, we used three additional human gastric cancer cell lines (KATOIII, MKN28 and MKN45). In conclusion, we propose that our model allows the response of gastric cancer cell lines to cetuximab treatment to be predicted.},

	Abstract = {Multipotent differentiation, where cells adopt one of several possible fates, occurs in diverse systems ranging from bacteria to mammals. This decision-making process is driven by multiple differentiation programs that operate simultaneously in the cell. How these programs interact to govern cell fate choice is poorly understood. To investigate this issue, we simultaneously measured activities of the competing sporulation and competence programs in single Bacillus subtilis cells. This approach revealed that these competing differentiation programs progress independently without cross-regulation before the decision point. Cells seem to arrive at a fate choice through differences in the relative timing between the two programs. To test this proposed dynamic mechanism, we altered the relative timing by engineering artificial cross-regulation between the sporulation and competence circuits. Results suggest a simple model that does not require a checkpoint or intricate cross-regulation before cellular decision-making. Rather, cell fate choice appears to be the outcome of a 'molecular race' between differentiation programs that compete in time, providing a simple dynamic mechanism for decision-making.},

	Abstract = {Regulated changes in gene expression underlie many biological processes, but globally profiling cell-to-cell variations in transcriptional regulation is problematic when measuring single cells. Transcriptome-wide identification of regulatory heterogeneities can be robustly achieved by randomly collecting small numbers of cells followed by statistical analysis. However, this stochastic-profiling approach blurs out the expression states of the individual cells in each pooled sample. Here, we show that the underlying distribution of single-cell regulatory states can be deconvolved from stochastic-profiling data through maximum-likelihood inference. Guided by the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, we formulated plausible mixture models for cell-to-cell regulatory heterogeneity and maximized the resulting likelihood functions to infer model parameters. Inferences were validated both computationally and experimentally for different mixture models, which included regulatory states for multicellular function that were occupied by as few as 1 in 40 cells of the population. Importantly, when the method was extended to programs of heterogeneously coexpressed transcripts, we found that population-level inferences were much more accurate with pooled samples than with one-cell samples when the extent of sampling was limited. Our deconvolution method provides a means to quantify the heterogeneous regulation of molecular states efficiently and gain a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous execution of cell decisions.},

Within this paper, two skeletal muscle models are presented. The first model is an electromechanical skeletal muscle model that couples neurophysiological recruitment principles and electrochemical processes of a sarcomere to the mechanical behavior of a single skeletal muscle through a multiscale continuum-mechanical constitutive law. The second model combines principles of multi-body dynamics and principles of continuum mechanics and the finite element method to achieve the first three-dimensional forward-dynamics model of a musculoskeletal system. Both muscle models can be coupled together in future research to obtain an overall skeletal muscle model spanning from cellular processes to a musculoskeletal system.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we extend the 3D multispecies diffuse-interface model of the tumor growth, which was derived in Wise et al. (Three-dimensional multispecies nonlinear tumor growth-I: model and numerical method, J. Theor. Biol. 253 (2008) 524-543), and incorporate the effect of a stiff membrane to model tumor growth in a confined microenvironment. We then develop accurate and efficient numerical methods to solve the model. When the membrane is endowed with a surface energy, the model is variational, and the numerical scheme, which involves adaptive mesh refinement and a nonlinear multigrid finite difference method, is demonstrably shown to be energy stable. Namely, in the absence of cell proliferation and death, the discrete energy is a nonincreasing function of time for any time and space steps. When a simplified model of membrane elastic energy is used, the resulting model is derived analogously to the surface energy case. However, the elastic energy model is actually nonvariational because certain coupling terms are neglected. Nevertheless, a very stable numerical scheme is developed following the strategy used in the surface energy case. 2D and 3D simulations are performed that demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm and illustrate the shape instabilities and nonlinear effects of membrane elastic forces that may resist or enhance growth of the tumor. Compared with the standard Crank-Nicholson method, the time step can be up to 25 times larger using the new approach.},

In this diffuse interface approach, sharp interfaces are replaced by narrow transition layers that arise due to differential adhesive forces among the cell species. Accordingly, a continuum model of adhesion is introduced. The model is thermodynamically consistent, is related to recently developed mixture models, and thus is capable of providing a detailed description of tumor progression. The model is well-posed and consists of fourth-order nonlinear advection-reaction-diffusion equations (of Cahn-Hilliard-type) for the cell species coupled with reaction-diffusion equations for the substrate components. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that when the diffuse interface thickness tends to zero, the system reduces to a classical sharp interface model. Using a new fully adaptive and nonlinear multigrid/finite difference method, the system is simulated efficiently. In this first paper, we present simulations of unstable avascular tumor growth in two and three dimensions and demonstrate that our techniques now make large-scale three-dimensional simulations of tumors with complex morphologies computationally feasible. In part II of this study, we will investigate multispecies tumor invasion, tumor-induced angiogenesis, and focus on the morphological instabilities that may underlie invasive phenotypes.},

@book{DeutschDor2005,
	Abstract = {This book focuses on a challenging application field of cellular automata: pattern formation in biological systems, such as the growth of microorganisms, dynamics of cellular tissue and tumors, and formation of pigment cell patterns. These phenomena, resulting from complex cellular interactions, cannot be deduced solely from experimental analysis, but can be more easily examined using mathematical models, in particular, cellular automaton models.

While there are various books treating cellular automaton modeling, this interdisciplinary work is the first one covering biological applications. The book is divided into three parts: Part I deals with general principles, theories, and models of pattern formation; Part II examines cellular automaton modeling; and Part III explains various applications. The models and analytic techniques described may be extended to other exciting applications in biology, medicine, and immunology.

Key topics and features:
- Provides an introduction and historical account of the principles of biological pattern formation (morphogenesis)
- Gives an overview of mathematical modeling approaches to morphogenesis, and an introduction to cellular automata and analytic techniques
- A supplementary web-based Java applet---Cellular Automaton Simulator---enables interactive simulation of various cellular automaton applications described in the book; available on the internet at www.biomodeling.info 
- Self-contained presentation is accessible to a broad audience; only basic calculus and linear algebra are required
- Careful balance of theory, models, and applications useful to both experimentalists and theoreticians
- Includes suggestions for further research topics

The book is aimed at researchers, practitioners, and students in applied mathematics, mathematical biology, computational physics, bioengineering, and computer science interested in a cellular automaton approach to biological modeling. The book's accessible presentation and interdisciplinary approach make it suitable for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses and seminars in mathematical biology, biomodeling, and biocomputing.},

	Abstract = {Implicit filtering is a way to solve bound-constrained optimization problems for which derivative information is not available. Unlike methods that use interpolation to reconstruct the function and its higher derivatives, implicit filtering builds upon coordinate search and then interpolates to get an approximation of the gradient. Implicit Filtering describes the algorithm, its convergence theory and a new MATLAB{\textregistered} implementation. It is unique for being the only book in the area of derivative-free or sampling methods to be accompanied by publicly available software. It includes an overview of recent results on optimization of noisy functions, including results that depend on non-smooth analysis and results on the handling of constraints. This book is for graduate students who want to learn about this technology, scientists and engineers who wish to apply the methods to their problems and specialists who will use the ideas and the software from this book in their own research.},

The model presented in this article focuses mainly on the description of mechanical interactions of the growing tumour with the host tissue, their influence on tumour growth, and the attachment/detachment mechanisms between cells and ECM. Starting from some recent experimental evidences, we propose to describe the interaction forces involving the extracellular matrix via some concepts coming from viscoplasticity. We then apply the model to the description of the growth of tumour cords and the formation of fibrosis.},

	Abstract = {The main mechanisms that control the organization of multicellular tissues are still largely open. A commonly used tool to study basic control mechanisms are in vitro experiments in which the growth conditions can be widely varied. However, even in vitro experiments are not free from unknown or uncontrolled influences. One reason why mathematical models become more and more a popular complementary tool to experiments is that they permit the study of hypotheses free from unknown or uncontrolled influences that occur in experiments. Many model types have been considered so far to model multicellular organization ranging from detailed individual-cell based models with explicit representations of the cell shape to cellular automata models with no representation of cell shape, and continuum models, which consider a local density averaged over many individual cells. However, how the different model description may be linked, and, how a description on a coarser level may be constructed based on the knowledge of the finer, microscopic level, is still largely unknown. Here, we consider the example of monolayer growth in vitro to illustrate how, in a multi-step process starting from a single-cell based off-lattice-model that subsumes the information on the sub-cellular scale by characteristic cell-biophysical and cell-kinetic properties, a cellular automaton may be constructed whose rules have been chosen based on the findings in the off-lattice model. Finally, we use the cellular automaton model as a starting point to construct a multivariate master equation from a compartment approach from which a continuum model can be derived by a systematic coarse-graining procedure. We find that the resulting continuum equation largely captures the growth behavior of the CA model. The development of our models is guided by experimental observations on growing monolayers.},

The fundamental dynamical variables in the model are subcellular elements, which interact with each other through phenomenological intra- and intercellular potentials. Advantages of the model include i) adaptive cell-shape dynamics, ii) flexible accommodation of additional intracellular biology, and iii) the absence of an underlying grid. We present here a detailed description of the model, and use successive mean-field approximations to connect it to more coarse-grained approaches, such as discrete cell-based algorithms and coupled partial differential equations. We also discuss efficient algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an epithelial sheet. Given the biological flexibility of the model, we propose that it can be used effectively for modeling a range of multicellular processes, such as tumor dynamics and embryogenesis.},

Yet, the challenge for biology overall is to understand how organisms function. By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions, systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide `omics' studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components. Here, we outline the challenges faced by systems biology and discuss limitations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, which, despite these limitations, have already led to the discovery of mechanisms and principles that underlie cell function.},

	Abstract = {We show how to extend a recently proposed multilevel Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational complexity needed to compute expected values of functions of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The extension is nontrivial, exploiting a coupling of the requisite processes that is easy to simulate while providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and in a stark departure from other implementations of multilevel Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased estimator that is significantly less computationally expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the basic computational complexity of current approaches that have many names and variants across the scientific literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method, the residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example where the coupling idea alone, even without a multilevel discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled chemical reaction networks provide a very important application for this work. Hence, we use this context for our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and computational examples.},

	Abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious ``momentum'' variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor --- a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

	Abstract = {Sensitivity analysis quantifies the dependence of a system's behavior on the parameters that could possibly affect the dynamics. Calculation of sensitivities of stochastic chemical systems using Kinetic Monte Carlo and finite-difference-based methods is not only computationally intensive, but direct calculation of sensitivities by finite-difference-based methods of parameter perturbations converges very poorly. In this paper we develop an approach to this issue using a method based on the Girsanov measure transformation for jump processes to smooth the estimate of the sensitivity coefficients and make this estimation more accurate. We demonstrate the method with simple examples and discuss its appropriate use.},

	Abstract = {An efficient finite element method is developed to model the spreading of excitation in ventricular myocardium by treating the thin region of rapidly depolarizing tissue as a propagating wavefront. The model is used to investigate excitation propagation in the full canine ventricular myocardium. An eikonal-curvature equation and an eikonal-diffusion equation for excitation time are compared. A Petrov--Galerkin finite element method with cubic Hermite elements is developed to solve the eikonal-diffusion equation on a reasonably coarse mesh. The oscillatory errors seen when using the Galerkin weighted residual method with high mesh P{\'e}clet numbers are avoided by supplementing the Galerkin weights with C0 functions based on derivatives of the interpolation functions. The ratio of the Galerkin and supplementary weights is a function of the P{\'e}clet number such that, for one-dimensional propagation, the error in the solution is within a small constant factor of the optimal error achievable in the trial space. An additional no-inflow boundary term is developed to prevent spurious excitation from initiating on the boundary. The need for discretization in time is avoided by using a continuation method to gradually introduce the nonlinear term of the governing equation. A simulation is performed in an anisotropic model of the complete canine ventricular myocardium, with 2355 degrees of freedom for the dependent variable.},

	Abstract = {Recent developments in cardiac simulation have rendered the heart the most highly integrated example of a virtual organ. We are on the brink of a revolution in cardiac research, one in which computational modeling of proteins, cells, tissues, and the organ permit linking genomic and proteomic information to the integrated organ behavior, in the quest for a quantitative understanding of the functioning of the heart in health and disease. The goal of this review is to assess the existing state-of-the-art in whole-heart modeling and the plethora of its applications in cardiac research. General whole-heart modeling approaches are presented, and the applications of whole-heart models in cardiac electrophysiology and electromechanics research are reviewed. The article showcases the contributions that whole-heart modeling and simulation have made to our understanding of the functioning of the heart. A summary of the future developments envisioned for the field of cardiac simulation and modeling is also presented. Biophysically based computational modeling of the heart, applied to human heart physiology and the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease, has the potential to dramatically change 21st century cardiac research and the field of cardiology.},

Moreover, both imaging and image analysis have been improved which offers new possibilities to quantify the three-dimensional organization of cells and tissues. However, research in disease pathogenesis is often hampered by the difficulty to understand the complex, time-resolved interplay among numerous components. Here, mathematical modelling helps clarifying the underlying principles. The mathematical models formalize the relationship between individual components, test their interactions in a virtual setting and may even simulate influences that are (still) difficult to analyse experimentally.

Those conditions, which amount to the expectations of the summary statistics differing asymptotically under the two models, are quite natural and can be exploited in approximate Bayesian computation settings to infer whether or not a choice of summary statistics is appropriate, via a Monte Carlo validation.},

	Abstract = {We describe the dynamics of competing species in terms of interactions between spatial moments. We close the moment hierarchy by employing a Gaussian approximation which assumes that fluctuations are independent and distributed normally about the mean values. The Gaussian approximation provides the lowest-order systematic correction to the mean-field approximation by incorporating the effect of fluctuations. When there are no fluctuations in the system, the mean equations agree with the Gaussian approximation as the fluctuations are weak. As the fluctuations gain strength, they influence the mean quantities and hence the Gaussian approximation departs from the mean-field approximation. At large fluctuation levels, the Gaussian approximation breaks down, as may be explained by the bimodality and skewness of the fluctuation distribution of the partial differential equation.},

	Abstract = {Spatial patterns in biological populations and the effect of spatial patterns on ecological interactions are central topics in mathematical ecology. Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by "moment closure," neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models. },

	Abstract = {It is common that only a subset of the parameters of dynamic models can be accurately estimated. One approach for identifying a subset of parameters for estimation is to perform clustering of the parameters into groups based upon their sensitivity vectors. However, this approach has the drawback that uncertainty cannot be directly incorporated as the sensitivity vectors are based upon the nominal values of the parameters. One technique to address this deficiency is to define sensitivity cones, where a sensitivity cone includes all possible sensitivity vectors of one parameter for different values resulting from the uncertainty. Parameter clustering can then be performed based upon the sensitivity cones, instead of the sensitivity vectors. This paper applies this new approach to a signal transduction pathway model with a large number of uncertain parameters.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the influence of two major aspects on the solution quality of surrogate model algorithms for computationally expensive black-box global optimization problems, namely the surrogate model choice and the method of iteratively selecting sample points. A random sampling strategy (algorithm SO-M-c) and a strategy where the minimum point of the response surface is used as new sample point (algorithm SO-M-s) are compared in numerical experiments. Various surrogate models and their combinations have been used within the SO-M-c and SO-M-s sampling frameworks. The Dempster--Shafer Theory approach used in the algorithm by M{\"u}ller and Pich{\'e} (J Glob Optim 51:79--104, 2011) has been used for combining the surrogate models. The algorithms are numerically compared on 13 deterministic literature test problems with 2--30 dimensions, an application problem that deals with groundwater bioremediation, and an application that arises in energy generation using tethered kites. NOMAD and the particle swarm pattern search algorithm (PSWARM), which are derivative-free optimization methods, have been included in the comparison. The algorithms have also been compared to a kriging method that uses the expected improvement as sampling strategy (FEI), which is similar to the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm. Data and performance profiles show that surrogate model combinations containing the cubic radial basis function (RBF) model work best regardless of the sampling strategy, whereas using only a polynomial regression model should be avoided. Kriging and combinations including kriging perform in general worse than when RBF models are used. NOMAD, PSWARM, and FEI perform for most problems worse than SO-M-s and SO-M-c. Within the scope of this study a Matlab toolbox has been developed that allows the user to choose, among others, between various sampling strategies and surrogate models and their combinations. The open source toolbox is available from the authors upon request.},

The key element is to learn the interface between the different scales using a fast surrogate for the microscale model, which is given by multivariate kernel expansions. The expansions are computed using statistically representative samples of input and output of the microscale model. We apply both support vector machines and a vectorial kernel greedy algorithm as learning methods. We demonstrate the applicability of the resulting surrogate models using two multiscale models from different engineering disciplines. We consider, first, a human spine model coupling a macroscale multibody system with a microscale intervertebral spine disc model and, second, a model for simulation of saturation overshoots in porous media involving nonclassical shock waves.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a master--worker framework for parallel global optimization of computationally expensive functions using response surface models. In particular, we parallelize two radial basis function (RBF) methods for global optimization, namely, the RBF method by Gutmann [Gutmann, H.M., 2001a. A radial basis function method for global optimization. Journal of Global Optimization 19(3), 201--227] (Gutmann-RBF) and the RBF method by Regis and Shoemaker [Regis, R.G., Shoemaker, C.A., 2005. Constrained global optimization of expensive black box functions using radial basis functions, Journal of Global Optimization 31, 153--171] (CORS-RBF). We modify these algorithms so that they can generate multiple points for simultaneous evaluation in parallel. We compare the performance of the two parallel RBF methods with a parallel multistart derivative-based algorithm, a parallel multistart derivative-free trust-region algorithm, and a parallel evolutionary algorithm on eleven test problems and on a 6-dimensional groundwater bioremediation application. The results indicate that the two parallel RBF algorithms are generally better than the other three alternatives on most of the test problems. Moreover, the two parallel RBF algorithms have comparable performances on the test problems considered. Finally, we report good speedups for both parallel RBF algorithms when using a small number of processors.},

@article{KallenbergerBea2014,
	Abstract = {Apoptosis in response to the ligand CD95L (also known as Fas ligand) is initiated by caspase-8, which is activated by dimerization and self-cleavage at death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs). Previous work indicated that the degree of substrate cleavage by caspase-8 determines whether a cell dies or survives in response to a death stimulus. To determine how a death ligand stimulus is effectively translated into caspase-8 activity, we assessed this activity over time in single cells with compartmentalized probes that are cleaved by caspase-8 and used multiscale modeling to simultaneously describe single-cell and population data with an ensemble of single-cell models. We derived and experimentally validated a minimal model in which cleavage of caspase-8 in the enzymatic domain occurs in an interdimeric manner through interaction between DISCs, whereas prodomain cleavage sites are cleaved in an intradimeric manner within DISCs. Modeling indicated that sustained membrane-bound caspase-8 activity is followed by transient cytosolic activity, which can be interpreted as a molecular timer mechanism reflected by a limited lifetime of active caspase-8. The activation of caspase-8 by combined intra- and interdimeric cleavage ensures weak signaling at low concentrations of CD95L and strongly accelerated activation at higher ligand concentrations, thereby contributing to precise control of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Multidimensional growth processes play an important role in many fields of applications, such as crystallization processes and cell culture engin- eering. The numerical solution of the corresponding multivariate population balance equations is quite challenging as standard discretization-based methods are not efficient for high dimensional problems. For this reason, the distribution dynamics is often characterized by its moments. However, the moment dynamics generally cannot be calculated in closed form. Existing approximation techniques cannot be implemented efficiently in the multivariate framework, in particular for high dimensional problems. This contribution presents an alternative methodology for the efficient approximate computation of moments for multidimensional growth processes using Monomial Cubatures and the Method of Characteristics (MOC). The procedure will be shown to reproduce the moments accurately for one- and two-dimensional examples which feature nonlinear growth rates and coupling to a continuous phase, respectively. Furthermore numerical effort and accuracy will be analyzed for a five-dimensional benchmark problem.},

	Abstract = {We investigate whether it is possible to use the bidomain model and body surface potential maps (BSPMs) to compute the size and position of ischemic regions in the human heart. This leads to a severely ill posed inverse problem for a potential equation. We do not use the classical inverse problems of electrocardiography, in which the unknown sources are the epicardial potential distribution or the activation sequence. Instead we employ the bidomain theory to obtain a model that also enables identification of ischemic regions transmurally. This approach makes it possible to distinguish between subendocardial and transmural cases, only using the BSPM data. The main focus is on testing a previously published algorithm on clinical data, and the results are compared with images taken with perfusion scintigraphy. For the four patients involved in this study, the two modalities produce results that are rather similar: The relative differences between the center of mass and the size of the ischemic regions, suggested by the two modalities, are 10.8% $\pm$ 4.4% and 7.1% $\pm$ 4.6%, respectively. We also present some simulations which indicate that the methodology is robust with respect to uncertainties in important model parameters. However, in contrast to what has been observed in investigations only involving synthetic data, inequality constraints are needed to obtain sound results.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow simulations in patient-specific models of the subarachnoid space characterize CSF flow in more detail than MR flow imaging. We extended previous simulation studies by including cyclic CSF flow and patient-specific models in multiple patients with Chiari I. We compared simulation results with MR flow measurements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric high resolution image sets acquired in 7 patients with Chiari I, 3 patients who had previous craniovertebral decompression, and 3 controls were segmented and converted to mathematical models of the subarachnoid space. CSF flow velocities and pressures were calculated with high spatial and temporal resolution during simulated oscillatory flow in each model with the Navier-Stokes equations. Pressures, velocities, and bidirectional flow were compared in the groups (with Student t test). Peak velocities in the simulations were compared with peak velocities measured in vivo with PCMR.

RESULTS: Flow visualization for patients and volunteers demonstrated nonuniform reversing patterns resembling those observed with PCMR. Velocities in the 13 subjects were greater between C2 and C5 than in the foramen magnum. Chiari patients had significantly greater peak systolic and diastolic velocities, synchronous bidirectional flow, and pressure gradients than controls. Peak velocities measured in PCMR correlated significantly (P = .003; regression analysis) despite differences between them.

CONCLUSIONS: In simulations of CSF, patients with Chiari I had significantly greater peak systolic and diastolic velocities, synchronous bidirectional flow, and pressure gradients than controls.},

In this study we extend a previously published semi-implicit numerical scheme with good stability properties that has been used to solve the bidomain equations (Whiteley, J.P. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 53:2139--2147, 2006). A new, efficient numerical scheme is developed which utilizes the observation that the only component of the ionic current that must be calculated on a fine spatial mesh and updated frequently is the fast sodium current. Other components of the ionic current may be calculated on a coarser mesh and updated less frequently, and then interpolated onto the finer mesh. Use of this technique to calculate the transmembrane potential and extracellular potential induces very little error in the solution. For the simulations presented in this study an increase in computational efficiency of over two orders of magnitude over standard numerical techniques is obtained.},

@article{NealCoo2014,
	Abstract = {Biological researchers increasingly rely on computational models to integrate biological systems knowledge, test hypotheses, and forecast system behavior. The expanding size of these models requires solutions for managing their complexity. Modularity, a time-tested design principle for managing complexity, can be applied within the biological modeling field to parallelize work, automate composition, and promote effective model sharing. As modelers of complex biological systems, we aim to apply modular production to accelerate our efforts and have therefore investigated several currently available approaches for modular modeling. We argue that some traditional features of modularity, in particular the isolation of a module's contents from the rest of the system, can impede model sharing and composition when applied within the context of biological simulation. Alternative approaches that can automatically interface model components based on the biological meaning of their contents (their semantics) avoid these limitations. Our conclusions have strategic implications for the design of systems biology, synthetic biology, and integrated physiological modeling technologies, as well as community-level model curation efforts.},

	Abstract = {Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is the leading exchange format for mathematical models in Systems Biology. Semantic annotations link model elements with external knowledge via unique database identifiers and ontology terms, enabling software to check and process models by their biochemical meaning. Such information is essential for model merging, one of the key steps towards the construction of large kinetic models. SemanticSBML is a tool that helps users to check and edit MIRIAM annotations and SBO terms in SBML models. Using a large collection of biochemical names and database identifiers, it supports modellers in finding the right annotations and in merging existing models. Initially, an element matching is derived from the MIRIAM annotations and conflicting element attributes are categorized and highlighted. Conflicts can then be resolved automatically or manually, allowing the user to control the merging process in detail.},

These models present challenges stemming from their interdisciplinary nature and from their computational and algorithmic complexities. The computational complexity of individual models, combined with the popularity of the distributed-memory parallel programming model used on commodity micro-processor-based clusters, results in a parallel coupling problem when building a coupled model. We define and elucidate this problem and how it results in a set of requirements for software capable of simplifying the construction of parallel coupled models. We describe the package, the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT), which we have developed to meet these general requirements and the specific requirements of a parallel climate model. We present the MCT programming model with illustrative code examples. We present representative results that measure MCT's scalability, performance portability, and a proxy for coupling overhead.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

Standard compartmental models represent little biological detail, which hampers the integration of multiscale data and confines predictive capabilities. We developed a detailed, generic physiologically based whole-body model of the glucose-insulin-glucagon regulatory system, reflecting detailed physiological properties of healthy populations and type 1 diabetes individuals expressed in the respective parameterizations. The model features a detailed representation of absorption models for oral glucose, subcutaneous insulin and glucagon, and an insulin receptor model relating pharmacokinetic properties to pharmacodynamic effects. Model development and validation is based on literature data. The quality of predictions is high and captures relevant observed inter- and intra-individual variability.

	Abstract = {An essential and so far unresolved factor influencing the evolution of cancer and the clinical management of patients is intra-tumor clonal and phenotypic heterogeneity. However, the de novo identification of tumor subpopulations is a so far challenging, if not an unresolved, task. Here we present the first systematic approach for the de novo discovery of clinically detrimental molecular tumor subpopulations. In this proof-of-principle study, spatially-resolved, tumor-specific mass spectra were acquired using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry from tissues of 63 gastric carcinoma and 32 breast carcinoma patients. The mass spectra, representing the proteomic heterogeneity within tumor areas, were grouped by a corroborated statistical clustering algorithm in order to obtain segmentation maps of molecularly distinct regions. These regions were presumed to represent different phenotypic tumor subpopulations. This was confirmed by linking the presence of these tumor subpopulations to the patients' clinical data. This revealed several of the detected tumor subpopulations to be associated with a different overall survival of the gastric cancer patients (P = 0.025) and the presence of locoregional metastases in patients with breast cancer (P = 0.036). The procedure presented is generic and opens novel options in cancer research as it reveals microscopically indistinct tumor subpopulations that have an adverse impact on clinical outcome. This enables their further molecular characterization for deeper insights into the biological processes of cancer which may finally lead to new targeted therapies.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Recent advances in DNA microarray technologies have made it possible to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously under different conditions. The data obtained by microarray analyses are called expression profile data. One type of important information underlying the expression profile data is the `genetic network,' that is, the regulatory network among genes. Graphical Gaussian Modeling (GGM) is a widely utilized method to infer or test relationships among a plural of variables.

Results: In this study, we developed a method combining the cluster analysis with GGM for the inference of the genetic network from the expression profile data. The expression profile data of 2467 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes measured under 79 different conditions (Eisen et al. , Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA , 95, 14683--14868, 1998) were used for this study. At first, the 2467 genes were classified into 34 clusters by a cluster analysis, as a preprocessing for GGM. Then, the expression levels of the genes in each cluster were averaged for each condition. The averaged expression profile data of 34 clusters were subjected to GGM, and a partial correlation coefficient matrix was obtained as a model of the genetic network of S. cerevisiae. The accuracy of the inferred network was examined by the agreement of our results with the cumulative results of experimental studies.

	Abstract = {Mathematical methods combined with measurements of single-cell dynamics provide a means to reconstruct intracellular processes that are only partly or indirectly accessible experimentally. To obtain reliable reconstructions, the pooling of measurements from several cells of a clonal population is mandatory. However, cell-to-cell variability originating from diverse sources poses computational challenges for such process reconstruction. We introduce a scalable Bayesian inference framework that properly accounts for population heterogeneity. The method allows inference of inaccessible molecular states and kinetic parameters; computation of Bayes factors for model selection; and dissection of intrinsic, extrinsic and technical noise. We show how additional single-cell readouts such as morphological features can be included in the analysis. We use the method to reconstruct the expression dynamics of a gene under an inducible promoter in yeast from time-lapse microscopy data.},

	Abstract = {Purpose
Inter-individual variability in clinical endpoints and occurrence of potentially severe adverse effects represent an enormous challenge in drug development at all phases of (pre-)clinical research. To ensure patient safety it is important to identify adverse events or critical subgroups within the population as early as possible. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the processes governing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is of utmost importance. In this paper we combine Bayesian statistics with detailed mechanistic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. On the example of pravastatin we demonstrate that this combination provides a powerful tool to investigate inter-individual variability in groups of patients and to identify clinically relevant homogenous subgroups in an unsupervised approach. Since PBPK models allow the identification of physiological, drug-specific and genotype-specific knowledge separately, our approach supports knowledge-based extrapolation to other drugs or populations.

Methods
PBPK models are based on generic distribution models and extensive collections of physiological parameters and allow a mechanistic investigation of drug distribution and drug action. To systematically account for parameter variability within patient populations, a Bayesian-PBPK approach is developed rigorously quantifying the probability of a parameter given the amount of information contained in the measured data. Since these parameter distributions are high-dimensional, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used, where the physiological and drug-specific parameters are considered in separate blocks.

Results
Considering pravastatin pharmacokinetics as an application example, Bayesian-PBPK is used to investigate inter-individual variability in a cohort of 10 patients. Correlation analyses infer structural information about the PBPK model. Moreover, homogeneous subpopulations are identified a posteriori by examining the parameter distributions, which can even be assigned to a polymorphism in the hepatic organ anion transporter OATP1B1.

Conclusions
The presented Bayesian-PBPK approach systematically characterizes inter-individual variability within a population by updating prior knowledge about physiological parameters with new experimental data. Moreover, clinically relevant homogeneous subpopulations can be mechanistically identified. The large scale PBPK model separates physiological and drug-specific knowledge which allows, in combination with Bayesian approaches, the iterative assessment of specific populations by integrating information from several drugs.

Analysis of metal abundances using the mass cytometer allows determination of marker expression in individual cells. Mass cytometry has previously been applied only to cell suspensions. To gain spatial information, we have coupled immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical methods with high-resolution laser ablation to CyTOF mass cytometry. This approach enables the simultaneous imaging of 32 proteins and protein modifications at subcellular resolution; with the availability of additional isotopes, measurement of over 100 markers will be possible. We applied imaging mass cytometry to human breast cancer samples, allowing delineation of cell subpopulations and cell-cell interactions and highlighting tumor heterogeneity. Imaging mass cytometry complements existing imaging approaches. It will enable basic studies of tissue heterogeneity and function and support the transition of medicine toward individualized molecularly targeted diagnosis and therapies.},

	Abstract = {Metabolites are the end products of cellular regulatory processes, and their levels can be regarded as the ultimate response of biological systems to genetic or environmental changes. In parallel to the terms 'transcriptome' and proteome', the set of metabolites synthesized by a biological system constitute its 'metabolome'. Yet, unlike other functional genomics approaches, the unbiased simultaneous identification and quantification of plant metabolomes has been largely neglected. Until recently, most analyses were restricted to profiling selected classes of compounds, or to fingerprinting metabolic changes without sufficient analytical resolution to determine metabolite levels and identities individually. As a prerequisite for metabolomic analysis, careful consideration of the methods employed for tissue extraction, sample preparation, data acquisition, and data mining must be taken. In this review, the differences among metabolite target analysis, metabolite profiling, and metabolic fingerprinting are clarified, and terms are defined. Current approaches are examined, and potential applications are summarized with a special emphasis on data mining and mathematical modelling of metabolism.},

@article{Mardis2010,
	Abstract = {Having recently attended the Personal Genomes meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (I was an organizer this year), I was struck by the number of talks that described the use of whole-genome sequencing and analysis to reveal the genetic basis of disease in patients. These patients included a child with irritable bowel disease, a child with severe combined immunodeficiency, two siblings affected with Miller syndrome, and several with cancers of different types. Although each presenter emphasized the rapidity with which these data can now be generated using next-generation sequencing instruments, they also listed the large number of people involved in the analysis of these datasets. The required expertise to 'solve' each case included molecular and computational biologists, geneticists, pathologists and physicians with exquisite knowledge of the disease and of treatment modalities, research nurses, genetic counselors, and IT and systems support specialists, among others. While much of the attendant effort was focused on the absolute importance of obtaining the correct diagnosis, the large number of specialists was critical for the completion of the data analysis, the annotation of variants, the interpretive 'filtering' necessary to deduce the causative or 'actionable' variants, the clinical verification of these variants, and the communication of results and their ramifications to the treating physician, and ultimately to the patient. At the end of the day, although the idea of clinical whole-genome sequencing for diagnosis is exciting and potentially life-changing for these patients, one does wonder how, in the clinical translation required for this practice to become commonplace, such a 'dream team' of specialists would be assembled for each case. In other words, even if the cost and speed of generating sequencing data continue their precipitous decreases, the cost of 'team' analysis seems unlikely to immediately follow suit. However, rather than predicting from this reasoning that widespread diagnosis by sequencing is unlikely to occur widely, it is perhaps more fruitful to predict, in my opinion, what is probably required for it to occur. I therefore offer the following as food for thought.

One source of difficulty in using resequencing approaches for diagnosis centers on the need to improve the quality and completeness of the human reference genome. In terms of quality, it is clear that the clone-based methods used to map, assign a minimal tiling path, and sequence the human reference genome did not yield a properly assembled or contiguous sequence equally across all loci. Lack of proper assembly is often due to collapsing of sequence within repetitive regions, such as segmental duplications, wherein genes can be found once the correct clones are identified and sequenced. At some loci, the current reference contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that occurs at the minor allele frequency rather than being the major allele. In addition, some loci cannot be represented by a single tiling path and require multiple clone tiling paths to capture all of the sequence variations. All of these deficiencies and others not cited provide a less-than-optimal alignment target for next-generation sequencing data and can confound the analytical validity of variants necessary to properly interpret patient-derived data. Hence, although it is difficult work to perform, the ongoing efforts of the Genome Resource Consortium [1] to improve the overall completeness and correctness of the human reference genome should be enhanced.

Along these lines, although projects such as the early SNP Consortium [2], the subsequent HapMap projects [3-5], and more recently the 1,000 Genomes Project [6] have identified millions of SNPs in multiple ethnic groups, there is much more diversity to the human genome than single base differences. In some ways, the broader scope of 'beyond SNP' diversity of the genome across human populations remains mysterious, including common copy number polymorphisms, large insertions and deletions, and inversions. Mining the 1,000 Genomes data using methods to identify genome-wide structural variation should augment this considerably [7], with validation playing an important role, as many methods are still nascent. Lastly, devising clever ways to provide all such classes of variants as a 'searchable space' for sequence data alignment remains a significant challenge, as does the development of sequence alignment algorithms that facilitate the analysis of structurally complex loci.

How well do we understand the functions encoded by our genome? Certainly, comprehensive functional information about proteins, including the impact of mutations, is complete for relatively few genes. The development of high-throughput systems for biochemistry and enzymology could have a dramatic impact on this deficiency and would add vitality to these areas of scientific endeavor. Efforts that annotate regulatory protein binding sites, sites of RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, and other motifs that contribute to transcriptional regulation in the human genome must continue. Improved understanding of these regions, and thus their annotation, will require the power of model-organism-based systems to identify and characterize functional proteins or mechanisms that are shared with humans. We also must transfer these findings into human cell experimental systems that allow researchers to examine the impact of the mutations or other alterations of the genome on cellular pathways and the resulting disease biology. With functional consequences in hand, we will begin to understand and associate the clinical validity of genomic variants, effectively enabling the correlation of variant(s) with the resultant phenotype(s).

If our efforts to improve the human reference sequence quality, variation, and annotation are successful, how do we avoid the pitfall of having cheap human genome resequencing but complex and expensive manual analysis to make clinical sense out of the data? One approach would emphasize the development of 'clinical grade' interpretational analysis pipelines to perform much of the initial discovery from datasets derived from massively parallel sequencing [8]. Although such pipelines already exist in the research setting [9], manual checks and orthogonal validation of variants are required because of the ongoing development of the analytical approaches. Towards patient diagnoses, such validation could initially be performed in a clinical laboratory medicine setting, but ultimately we must develop sophisticated analytical approaches and quality filters that enable high-confidence variant detection solely from the primary data. All discovered variants would then be interpreted in the context of the ever-improving human genome annotation and evaluated in the contexts of medical genetics, of demonstrated clinical validity, and of the pharmaceutical databases (when appropriate), to identify causative or therapeutically actionable genes. Ultimately, as in medicine today, the results will require interpretation by a physician, which raises a separate but equally important issue: the significant need to develop and implement training programs in genomics for medical professionals. Pathologists and genetic counselors will be the first in line for training programs focused on genomic diagnostics, and improving the genomics education of medical students will also be a first priority. More challenging will be the genomics education of practicing physicians and other medical professionals, many of whom do not require genetics to perform their valuable role in health care daily, but who will be confronted in the near term by increasingly well informed patients who expect their doctors to be as well versed as they are about genome-guided diagnosis and treatment.

A final word on the important topic of patient access to genome-guided medicine seems necessary and appropriate. The current high cost of whole-genome sequencing and analysis relative to most clinical diagnostic assays, coupled with the fact that these costs are not currently reimbursed by insurers, might mean that only those with the means to pay for the test will be allowed access. Perhaps worse, those with the fattest wallets might pay extra for a place higher in the queue, denying earlier access to patients who more desperately need the information. Although there are no easy answers here, one plausible solution might be the establishment of funds at major medical centers, where genome-guided medicine is likely to be practiced first, that pay for the genomic sequencing, diagnosis and associated costs and thus allow equitable access to this new assay.},

	Abstract = {Protein expression is a stochastic process that leads to phenotypic variation among cells. The cell-cell distribution of protein levels in microorganisms has been well characterized but little is known about such variability in human cells. Here, we studied the variability of protein levels in human cells, as well as the temporal dynamics of this variability, and addressed whether cells with higher than average protein levels eventually have lower than average levels, and if so, over what timescale does this mixing occur. We measured fluctuations over time in the levels of 20 endogenous proteins in living human cells, tagged by the gene for yellow fluorescent protein at their chromosomal loci. We found variability with a standard deviation that ranged, for different proteins, from about 15% to 30% of the mean. Mixing between high and low levels occurred for all proteins, but the mixing time was longer than two cell generations (more than 40 h) for many proteins. We also tagged pairs of proteins with two colours, and found that the levels of proteins in the same biological pathway were far more correlated than those of proteins in different pathways. The persistent memory for protein levels that we found might underlie individuality in cell behaviour and could set a timescale needed for signals to affect fully every member of a cell population.},

	Abstract = {Systems biology has to increasingly cope with large- and multi-scale biological systems. Many successful in silico representations and simulations of various cellular modules proved mathematical modelling to be an important tool in gaining a solid understanding of biological phenomena. However, models spanning different functional layers (e.g. metabolism, signalling and gene regulation) are still scarce. Consequently, model integration methods capable of fusing different types of biological networks and various model formalisms become a key methodology to increase the scope of cellular processes covered by mathematical models. Here we propose a new integration approach to couple logical models of signalling or/and gene-regulatory networks with kinetic models of metabolic processes. The procedure ends up with an integrated dynamic model of both layers relying on differential equations. The feasibility of the approach is shown in an illustrative case study integrating a kinetic model of central metabolic pathways in hepatocytes with a Boolean logical network depicting the hormonally induced signal transduction and gene regulation events involved. In silico simulations demonstrate the integrated model to qualitatively describe the physiological switch-like behaviour of hepatocytes in response to nutritionally regulated changes in extracellular glucagon and insulin levels. A simulated failure mode scenario addressing insulin resistance furthermore illustrates the pharmacological potential of a model covering interactions between signalling, gene regulation and metabolism.},

Liver toxicity, whether actual or implied is the reason for the failure of a significant proportion of many promising novel medicines that consequently never reach the market, and diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and fatty liver diseases, that are a major burden on current health resources, are directly linked to functional and structural disorders of the liver. This article presents the concepts and approaches underpinning one of the most exciting and ambitious modeling projects in the field of systems biology and systems medicine. This major multidisciplinary research program is aimed at developing a whole-organ model of the human liver, representing its central physiological functions under normal and pathological conditions The model will be composed of a larger battery of interconnected submodels representing liver anatomy and physiology, integrating processes across hierarchical levels in space, time, and structural organization. In this article, we outline the general architecture of the liver model and present first step taken to reach this ambitious goal.},

	Abstract = {Discontinuation of drug development projects due to lack of efficacy or adverse events is one of the main cost drivers in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). Investments have to be written-off and contribute to the total costs of a successful drug candidate receiving marketing authorization and allowing return on invest. A vital risk for pharmaceutical innovator companies is late stage clinical failure since costs for individual clinical trials may exceed the one billion Euro threshold. To guide investment decisions and to safeguard maximum medical benefit and safety for patients recruited in clinical trials, it is therefore essential to understand the clinical consequences of all information and data generated. The complexity of the physiological and pathophysiological processes and the sheer amount of information available overcharge the mental capacity of any human being and prevent a prediction of the success in clinical development. A rigorous integration of knowledge, assumption, and experimental data into computational models promises a significant improvement of the rationalization of decision making in pharmaceutical industry. We here give an overview of the current status of modeling and simulation in pharmaceutical R&D and outline the perspectives of more recent developments in mechanistic modeling. Specific modeling approaches for different biological scales ranging from intracellular processes to whole organism physiology are introduced and an example for integrative multiscale modeling of therapeutic efficiency in clinical oncology trials is showcased.},

	Abstract = {Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)-modeling links dose-concentration relationships (PK) and concentration-effect relationships (PD), thereby facilitating the description and prediction of the time course of drug effects resulting from a certain dosing regimen. PK/PD-modeling approaches can basically be distinguished by four major attributes. The first characterizes the link between measured drug concentration and the response system, direct link versus indirect link. The second considers how the response system relates effect site concentration to the observed outcome, direct versus indirect response. The third regards what clinically or experimentally assessed information is used to establish the link between concentration and effect, hard link versus soft link. And the fourth considers the time dependency of pharmacodynamic model parameters, distinguishing between time-variant versus time-invariant. Application of PK/PD-modeling concepts has been identified as potentially beneficial in all phases of preclinical and clinical drug development. Although today predominantly limited to research, broader application of PK/PD-concepts in clinical therapy will provide a more rational basis for patient-specific dosage individualization and may thus guide applied pharmacotherapy to a higher level of performance.},

The multifaceted physiological role of the metabolic network fulfilling the catalytic conversions can only be fully understood from a whole-body perspective where the causal interplay of the metabolic states of individual cells, the surrounding tissue and the whole organism are simultaneously considered. We here present an approach relying on dynamic flux balance analysis that allows the integration of metabolic networks at the cellular scale into standardized physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models at the whole-body level. To evaluate our approach we integrated a genome-scale network reconstruction of a human hepatocyte into the liver tissue of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of a human adult. The resulting multiscale model was used to investigate hyperuricemia therapy, ammonia detoxification and paracetamol-induced toxication at a systems level. The specific models simultaneously integrate multiple layers of biological organization and offer mechanistic insights into pathology and medication. The approach presented may in future support a mechanistic understanding in diagnostics and drug development.},

	Abstract = {In clinical development stages, an a priori assessment of the sensitivity of the pharmacokinetic behavior with respect to physiological and anthropometric properties of human (sub-) populations is desirable. A physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) population model was developed that makes use of known distributions of physiological and anthropometric properties obtained from the literature for realistic populations. As input parameters, the simulation model requires race, gender, age, and two parameters out of body weight, height and body mass index. From this data, the parameters relevant for PBPK modeling such as organ volumes and blood flows are determined for each virtual individual. The resulting parameters were compared to those derived using a previously published model (P(3)M). Mean organ weights and blood flows were highly correlated between the two models, despite the different methods used to generate these parameters. The inter-individual variability differed greatly especially for organs with a log-normal weight distribution (such as fat and spleen). Two exemplary population pharmacokinetic simulations using ciprofloxacin and paclitaxel as model drugs showed good correlation to observed variability. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the physiological differences in the virtual individuals and intrinsic clearance variability were equally influential to the pharmacokinetic variability but were not additive. In conclusion, the new population model is well suited to assess the influence of individual physiological variability on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. It is expected that this new tool can be beneficially applied in the planning of clinical studies.},

These equations incorporate expressions for dissolution in tissue water and, partitioning into neutral lipids and neutral phospholipids. Additionally, associations with acidic phospholipids were incorporated for zwitterions with a highly basic functionality, or extracellular proteins for the other compound classes. The affinity for these cellular constituents was determined from blood cell data or plasma protein binding, respectively. These equations assume drugs are passively distributed and that processes are nonsaturating. Resultant Kpu predictions were more accurate when compared to published equations, with 84% as opposed to 61% of the predicted values agreeing with experimental values to within a factor of 3. This improvement was largely due to the incorporation of distribution processes related to drug ionisation, an issue that is not addressed in earlier equations. Such advancements in parameter prediction will assist WBPBPK modelling, where time, cost and labour requirements greatly deter its application.},

	Abstract = {Tissue-to-plasma water partition coefficients (Kpu's) form an integral part of whole body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WBPBPK) models. This research aims to improve the predictability of Kpu values for moderate-to-strong bases (pK(a) > or = 7), by developing a mechanistic equation that accommodates the unique electrostatic interactions of such drugs with tissue acidic phospholipids, where the affinity of this interaction is readily estimated from drug blood cell binding data. Additional model constituents are drug partitioning into neutral lipids and neutral phospholipids, and drug dissolution in tissue water. Major assumptions of this equation are that electrostatic interactions predominate, drugs distribute passively, and non-saturating conditions prevail. Resultant Kpu predictions for 28 moderate-to-strong bases were significantly more accurate than published equations with 89%, compared to 45%, of the predictions being within a factor of three of experimental values in rat adipose, bone, gut, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, skin, spleen and thymus. Predictions in rat brain and lung were less accurate probably due to the involvement of additional processes not incorporated within the equation. This overall improvement in prediction should facilitate the further application of WBPBPK modeling, where time, cost and labor requirements associated with experimentally determining Kpu's have, to a large extent, deterred its application.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is a progressive disease characterized by loss of functional hepatocytes with concomitant connective tissue and nodule formation in the liver. The morphological and physiological changes associated with the disease substantially affect drug pharmacokinetics. Whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WB-PBPK) modelling is a predictive technique that quantitatively relates the pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug to such (patho-)physiological conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To extend an existing WB-PBPK model, based on the physiological changes associated with liver cirrhosis, which allows for prediction of drug pharmacokinetics in patients with liver cirrhosis.

METHODS: The literature was searched for quantitative measures of the physiological changes associated with the presence of Child-Pugh class A through C liver cirrhosis. The parameters that were included were the organ blood flows, cardiac index, plasma binding protein concentrations, haematocrit, functional liver volume, hepatic enzymatic activity and glomerular filtration rate. Predictions of pharmacokinetic profiles and parameters were compared with literature data for the model compounds alfentanil, lidocaine (lignocaine), theophylline and levetiracetam.

RESULTS: The predicted versus observed plasma concentration-time profiles for alfentanil and lidocaine were similar, such that the pharmacokinetic changes associated with Child-Pugh class A, B and C liver cirrhosis were adequately described. The theophylline elimination half-life was greatly increased in Child-Pugh class B and C patients compared with controls, as predicted by the model. Levetiracetam urinary excretion was consistently reduced with disease progression and very closely resembled observed values.

CONCLUSION: Consideration of the physiological differences between healthy individuals and patients with liver cirrhosis was important for the simulation of drug pharmacokinetics in this compromised group. The WB-PBPK model was altered to incorporate these physiological differences with the result of adequate simulation of drug pharmacokinetics. The information provided in this study will allow other researchers to further validate this liver cirrhosis model within a WB-PBPK model.},

OBJECTIVES: To review the current state of WB-PBPK model use in the clinical phases of drug development.

METHODS: A qualitative description of the WB-PBPK model structure is included along with a review of the varying methods available for input parameterisation. Current and potential WB-PBPK model application in clinical development is discussed.

CONCLUSIONS: This modelling tool is at present used for small and large molecule drug development primarily as a means to scale pharmacokinetics from animals to humans based on physiology. The pharmaceutical industry is active in employing these models to clinical drug development although the applications in use now are narrow in comparison to the potential. Expanded integration of WB-PBPK models into the drug development process will only be achieved with staff training, managerial will, success stories and regulatory agency openness.},

Brain tissue is permeated by two viscous pore liquids, the interstitial fluid and the blood. Both liquids are mobile within the tissue and exhibit a significant anisotropic perfusion behaviour. To model this complex aggregate, the well-founded Theory of Porous Media, a continuum-mechanical approach for the description of multi-component aggregates, is used. To include microscopic information, the model is enhanced by tissue characteristics obtained from medical imaging techniques. Moreover, the model is applied to invasive drug-delivery strategies, i.e. the direct extra-vascular infusion of therapeutic agents. For this purpose, the overall interstitial fluid is treated as a real two-component mixture of a liquid solvent and a dissolved therapeutic solute. Finally, the continuum-mechanical model results in a set of strongly coupled partial differential equations which are spatially discretised using mixed finite elements and solved in a monolithic manner with an implicit Euler time-integration scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the presented model.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale models accounting for the processes supporting metabolism and function in an organ or tissue with a marked heterogeneity of flows and metabolic rates are computationally complex and tedious to compute. Their use in the analysis of data from positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires model reduction since the data are composed of concentration-time curves from hundreds of regions of interest (ROI) within the organ. Within each ROI, one must account for blood flow, intracapillary gradients in concentrations, transmembrane transport, and intracellular reactions. Using modular design, we configured a whole organ model, GENTEX, to allow adaptive usage for multiple reacting molecular species while omitting computation of unused components. The temporal and spatial resolution and the number of species are adaptable and the numerical accuracy and computational speed is adjustable during optimization runs, which increases accuracy and spatial resolution as convergence approaches. An application to the interpretation of PET image sequences after intravenous injection of 13NH3 provides functional image maps of regional myocardial blood flows.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we apply a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady nonlinear fluid model to study human pulmonary circulation. Eighteen generations of blood vessels composed of the branching arterial, capillary and venous distensible vessel segments make up the complete pulmonary circulation. The numerical result gives satisfactory agreement with the physiological experimental data: a dramatic pressure drop occurs in the arterioles and postcapillaries, a negative transmural pressure is shown in the postcapillary and small venous segments, a large reverse flow occurs in the main pulmonary artery during the diastolic period, and the reverse flow decreases gradually along the pulmonary tree. In the microgravity case where g = 180 cm s-2, the computation illustrated the effect of gravity force on the blood distribution in the different parts of the pulmonary circulation. The effect of gravity on the total output is not obvious. The effect of local factors which initiate the variations of the geometrical or pulmonary circulation can be stimulated quantitatively by this model. The proposal model can be very useful for clinical practice and for studying the extreme cases which are very difficult to investigate by experiments.},

	Abstract = {At its most fundamental level, cerebral blood flow (CBF) may be modeled as fluid flow driven through a network of resistors by pressure gradients. The composition of the blood as well as the cross-sectional area and length of a vessel are the major determinants of its resistance to flow. Here, we introduce a vascular graph modeling framework based on these principles that can compute blood pressure, flow and scalar transport in realistic vascular networks. By embedding the network in a computational grid representative of brain tissue, the interaction between the two compartments can be captured in a truly three-dimensional manner and may be applied, among others, to simulate oxygen extraction from the vessels. Moreover, we have devised an upscaling algorithm that significantly reduces the computational expense and eliminates the need for detailed knowledge on the topology of the capillary bed. The vascular graph framework has been applied to investigate the effect of local vascular dilation and occlusion on the flow in the surrounding network.},

	Abstract = {We propose a computational simulation framework for describing cancer-therapeutic transport in the lung. A discrete vascular graph model (VGM) is coupled to a double-continuum model (DCM) to determine the amount of administered therapeutic agent that will reach the cancer cells. An alveolar cell carcinoma is considered. The processes in the bigger blood vessels (arteries, arterioles, venules and veins) are described by the VGM. The processes in the alveolar capillaries and the surrounding tissue are represented by a continuum approach for porous media. The system of equations of the coupled discrete/continuum model contains terms that account for degradation processes of the therapeutic agent, the reduction of the number of drug molecules by the lymphatic system and the interaction of the drug with the tissue cells. The functionality of the coupled discrete/continuum model is demonstrated in example simulations using simplified pulmonary vascular networks, which are designed to show-off the capabilities of the model rather than being physiologically accurate.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that some biological processes are equivalent to computation, but quantitative evidence for that view is weak. Plants must solve the problem of adjusting stomatal apertures to allow sufficient CO2 uptake for photosynthesis while preventing excessive water loss. Under some conditions, stomatal apertures become synchronized into patches that exhibit richly complicated dynamics, similar to behaviors found in cellular automata that perform computational tasks. Using sequences of chlorophyll fluorescence images from leaves of Xanthium strumarium L. (cocklebur), we quantified spatial and temporal correlations in stomatal dynamics. Our values are statistically indistinguishable from those of the same correlations found in the dynamics of automata that compute. These results are consistent with the proposition that a plant solves its optimal gas exchange problem through an emergent, distributed computation performed by its leaves.},

	Abstract = {Only little is known about how cells coordinately behave to establish functional tissue structure and restore microarchitecture during regeneration. Research in this field is hampered by a lack of techniques that allow quantification of tissue architecture and its development. To bridge this gap, we have established a procedure based on confocal laser scans, image processing, and three-dimensional tissue reconstruction, as well as quantitative mathematical modeling. As a proof of principle, we reconstructed and modeled liver regeneration in mice after damage by CCl4, a prototypical inducer of pericentral liver damage. We have chosen the regenerating liver as an example because of the tight link between liver architecture and function: the complex microarchitecture formed by hepatocytes and microvessels, i.e. sinusoids, ensures optimal exchange of metabolites between blood and hepatocytes. Our model captures all hepatocytes and sinusoids of a liver lobule during a 16 days regeneration process. The model unambiguously predicted a so-far unrecognized mechanism as essential for liver regeneration, whereby daughter hepatocytes align along the orientation of the closest sinusoid, a process which we named ``hepatocyte-sinusoid alignment'' (HSA). The simulated tissue architecture was only in agreement with the experimentally obtained data when HSA was included into the model and, moreover, no other likely mechanism could replace it. In order to experimentally validate the model of prediction of HSA, we analyzed the three-dimensional orientation of daughter hepatocytes in relation to the sinusoids. The results of this analysis clearly confirmed the model prediction. We believe our procedure is widely applicable in the systems biology of tissues.},

This article shows the use of a stochastic simulation method to study the effects of the cytoskeleton structure on the mobility of macromolecules. Brownian dynamics and single particle tracking were used to simulate the diffusion process of individual molecules through a model cytoskeleton. The resulting average effective diffusion is in line with data obtained in the in vitro and in vivo experiments.

The simulation method used also allows the inclusion of reactions in order to model complete signaling pathways in their spatio-temporal dynamics, taking into account the effects of the cellular architecture.},

	Abstract = {The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.},

	Abstract = {A fully compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that accounts for 750 genes and their associated transcripts, proteins, and reactions has been reconstructed and validated. All of the 1149 reactions included in this in silico model are both elementally and charge balanced and have been assigned to one of eight cellular locations (extracellular space, cytosol, mitochondrion, peroxisome, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or vacuole). When in silico predictions of 4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83% agreement was found between iND750's predictions and the experimental studies. Analysis of the failure modes showed that false predictions were primarily caused by iND750's limited inclusion of cellular processes outside of metabolism. This study systematically identified inconsistencies in our knowledge of yeast metabolism that require specific further experimental investigation.},

	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging uses activity-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow to map brain activity, but the contributions of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity are incompletely understood, as are the underlying cellular pathways. Using intravital multiphoton microscopy, we measured presynaptic activity, postsynaptic neuronal and astrocytic calcium responses, and erythrocyte velocity and flux in olfactory glomeruli during odor stimulation in mice. Odor-evoked functional hyperemia in glomerular capillaries was highly correlated with glutamate release, but did not require local postsynaptic activity. Odor stimulation induced calcium transients in astrocyte endfeet and an associated dilation of upstream arterioles. Calcium elevations in astrocytes and functional hyperemia depended on astrocytic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and cyclooxygenase activation. Astrocytic glutamate transporters also contributed to functional hyperemia through mechanisms independent of calcium rises and cyclooxygenase activation. These local pathways initiated by glutamate account for a large part of the coupling between synaptic activity and functional hyperemia in the olfactory bulb.},

	Abstract = {There is a strong need for computational frameworks that integrate different biological processes and data-types to unravel cellular regulation. Current efforts to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) focus primarily on proximal data such as gene co-expression and transcription factor (TF) binding. While such approaches enable rapid reconstruction of TRNs, the overwhelming combinatorics of possible networks limits identification of mechanistic regulatory interactions. Utilizing growth phenotypes and systems-level constraints to inform regulatory network reconstruction is an unmet challenge. We present our approach Gene Expression and Metabolism Integrated for Network Inference (GEMINI) that links a compendium of candidate regulatory interactions with the metabolic network to predict their systems-level effect on growth phenotypes. We then compare predictions with experimental phenotype data to select phenotype-consistent regulatory interactions. GEMINI makes use of the observation that only a small fraction of regulatory network states are compatible with a viable metabolic network, and outputs a regulatory network that is simultaneously consistent with the input genome-scale metabolic network model, gene expression data, and TF knockout phenotypes. GEMINI preferentially recalls gold-standard interactions (p-value=102172), significantly better than using gene expression alone. We applied GEMINI to create an integrated metabolic-regulatory network model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving 25,000 regulatory interactions controlling 1597 metabolic reactions. The model quantitatively predicts TF knockout phenotypes in new conditions (p-value = 10214) and revealed potential condition-specific regulatory mechanisms. Our results suggest that a metabolic constraint-based approach can be successfully used to help reconstruct TRNs from high-throughput data, and highlights the potential of using a biochemically-detailed mechanistic framework to integrate and reconcile inconsistencies across different data-types. },

The total model could be quite complex, while the modules are well understood and analysed. A procedure to decide global parameter identifiability for such a collection of model equations of differential-algebraic nature is suggested. It is shown how to make use of the natural modularization of the model structure. Basically, global identifiability is obtained if and only if each module is identifiable, and the connecting signals can be retrieved from the external signals, without knowledge of the values of the parameters.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Cellular information processing can be described mathematically using differential equations. Often, external stimulation of cells by compounds such as drugs or hormones leading to activation has to be considered. Mathematically, the stimulus is represented by a time-dependent input function.

Parameters such as rate constants of the molecular interactions are often unknown and need to be estimated from experimental data, e.g. by maximum likelihood estimation. For this purpose, the input function has to be defined for all times of the integration interval. This is usually achieved by approximating the input by interpolation or smoothing of the measured data. This procedure is suboptimal since the input uncertainties are not considered in the estimation process which often leads to overoptimistic confidence intervals of the inferred parameters and the model dynamics.

Results: This article presents a new approach which includes the input estimation into the estimation process of the dynamical model parameters by minimizing an objective function containing all parameters simultaneously. We applied this comprehensive approach to an illustrative model with simulated data and compared it to alternative methods. Statistical analyses revealed that our method improves the prediction of the model dynamics and the confidence intervals leading to a proper coverage of the confidence intervals of the dynamic parameters. The method was applied to the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.},

	Abstract = {The aim of systems biology is to describe and understand biology at a global scale where biological functions are recognised as a result of complex mechanisms that happen at several scales, from the molecular to the ecosystem. Modelling and simulation are computational tools that are invaluable for description, prediction and understanding these mechanisms in a quantitative and integrative way. Therefore the study of biological functions is greatly aided by multi-scale methods that enable the coupling and simulation of models spanning several spatial and temporal scales. Various methods have been developed for solving multi-scale problems in many scientific disciplines, and are applicable to continuum based modelling techniques, in which the relationship between system properties is expressed with continuous mathematical equations or discrete modelling techniques that are based on individual units to model the heterogeneous microscopic elements such as individuals or cells. In this review, we survey these multi-scale methods and explore their application in systems biology.},

	Abstract = {Integration of data across spatial, temporal, and functional scales is a primary focus of biomedical engineering efforts. The advent of powerful computing platforms, coupled with quantitative data from high-throughput experimen- tal methodologies, has allowed multiscale modeling to expand as a means to more comprehensively investigate biological phenomena in experimentally relevant ways. This review aims to highlight recently published multiscale models of biological systems, using their successes to propose the best prac- tices for future model development. We demonstrate that coupling contin- uous and discrete systems best captures biological information across spatial scales by selecting modeling techniques that are suited to the task. Fur- ther, we suggest how to leverage these multiscale models to gain insight into biological systems using quantitative biomedical engineering methods to analyze data in nonintuitive ways. These topics are discussed with a focus on the future of the field, current challenges encountered, and opportunities yet to be realized.},

@phdthesis{vanderWath2009,
	Abstract = {In healthy adult multicellular organisms, daily production and loss of millions of blood cells due to normal cellular turnover are in equilibrium, a condition called homeostasis. During hematopoietic stress or after injury, homeostasis is rapidly restored by a small number of tightly regulated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. Until recently it was unclear how HSCs could be so effective in these very different tasks, since they seldom replicate to avoid accumulating DNA mutations, replicative senescence or exhaustion. The work presented in this thesis is at the frontier of a new paradigm in hematopoietic regulation that posit the existence of two related mouse HSC populations. First, a dormant HSC (d-HSC) population that actively divides only after hematopoietic injury, returning to a resting state once homeostasis has been restored. And second, an active HSC subset that by and large produces the progenitors and mature cells required for maintenance of day-to-day hematopoiesis.
We evaluate experimental and conceptual support for the d-HSC hypotheses from a systems biology perspective. Through extensive modelling of experimental DNA label- retaining cell data, we demonstrate how quantifying HSC division kinetics can assist in testing hypotheses about the population biology of HSCs. Our comprehensive analysis introduces novel discrete (agent-based), continuous (ordinary differential equation), and stochastic (Markov process) computational models, based on two independent datasets. All the results consistently show that under our assumptions only models accounting for a slowly dividing subpopulation of cells (putative d-HSCs) can describe the observed data satisfactorily. We subsequently derive a new conceptual model on dynamic hematopoietic regulation. In particular we investigate what the impact of the d-HSC population on dynamic maintenance and restoration of homeostasis is. Assuming the models we define are sound representations of the real biological system, bifurcation analysis reveals that malfunctioning d-HSCs are likely to play a central role in hematological diseases charac- terised by oscillatory peripheral cell numbers. Using elasticities as a measure, we provide well-grounded arguments that d-HSC regulation of hematopoiesis is evolutionarily more likely than conventional (d-HSC free) regulation of hematopoiesis.
The discovery of the d-HSC population has important implications for cancer treat- ment since recent evidence suggests that some cancer stem cells are also dormant, pro- viding an explanation for their remarkable resistance to chemotherapy.},

	Abstract = {Stem cells are proposed to segregate chromosomes asymmetrically during self-renewing divisions so that older ('immortal') DNA strands are retained in daughter stem cells whereas newly synthesized strands segregate to differentiating cells. Stem cells are also proposed to retain DNA labels, such as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), either because they segregate chromosomes asymmetrically or because they divide slowly. However, the purity of stem cells among BrdU-label-retaining cells has not been documented in any tissue, and the 'immortal strand hypothesis' has not been tested in a system with definitive stem cell markers. Here we tested these hypotheses in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which can be highly purified using well characterized markers. We administered BrdU to newborn mice, mice treated with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and normal adult mice for 4 to 10 days, followed by 70 days without BrdU. In each case, less than 6% of HSCs retained BrdU and less than 0.5% of all BrdU-retaining haematopoietic cells were HSCs, revealing that BrdU has poor specificity and poor sensitivity as an HSC marker. Sequential administration of 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine indicated that all HSCs segregate their chromosomes randomly. Division of individual HSCs in culture revealed no asymmetric segregation of the label. Thus, HSCs cannot be identified on the basis of BrdU-label retention and do not retain older DNA strands during division, indicating that these are not general properties of stem cells.},

	Abstract = {Parallel tempering is a generic Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method which allows good mixing with multimodal target distributions, where conventional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms often fail. The mixing properties of the sampler depend strongly on the choice of tuning parameters, such as the temperature schedule and the proposal distribution used for local exploration. We propose an adaptive algorithm which tunes both the temperature schedule and the parameters of the random-walk Metropolis kernel automatically. We prove the convergence of the adaptation and a strong law of large numbers for the algorithm. We illustrate the performance of our method with examples. Our empirical findings indicate that the algorithm can cope well with different kind of scenarios without prior tuning.},

@article{Schenkendorf2014,
	Abstract = {A general framework to approach the challenge of uncertainty propagation in model based prognostics is presented in this work. It is shown how the so-called Point Estimate Methods (PEMs) are ideally suited for this purpose because of the following reasons: 1) A credible propagation and represen- tation of Gaussian (normally distributed) uncertainty can be done with a minimum of computational effort for non-linear applications. 2) Also non-Gaussian uncertainties can be prop- agated by evaluating suitable transfer functions inherently. 3) Confidence intervals of simulation results can be derived which do not have to be symmetrically distributed around the mean value by applying PEM in conjunction with the Cornish-Fisher expansion. 4) Moreover, the entire probability function of simulation results can be reconstructed efficiently by the proposed framework. The joint evaluation of PEM with the Polynomial Chaos expansion methodology is likely to provide good approximation results. Thus, non-Gaussian probability density functions can be derived as well. 5) The presented framework of uncertainty propagation is derivative- free, i.e. even non-smooth (non-differentiable) propagation problems can be tackled in principle. 6) Although the PEM is sample-based the overall method is deterministic. Computational results are reproducible which might be important to safety critical applications. - Consequently, the proposed approach may play an essential part in contributing to render the prognostics and health management into a more credible process. A given study of a generic uncertainty propagation problem supports this issue illustratively.},

	Abstract = {Fluctuations in intracellular molecule abundance can lead to distinct, coexisting phenotypes in isogenic populations. Although metabolism continuously adapts to unpredictable environmental changes, and although bistability was found in certain substrate‐uptake pathways, central carbon metabolism is thought to operate deterministically. Here, we combine experiment and theory to demonstrate that a clonal Escherichia coli population splits into two stochastically generated phenotypic subpopulations after glucose‐gluconeogenic substrate shifts. Most cells refrain from growth, entering a dormant persister state that manifests as a lag phase in the population growth curve. The subpopulation‐generating mechanism resides at the metabolic core, overarches the metabolic and transcriptional networks, and only allows the growth of cells initially achieving sufficiently high gluconeogenic flux. Thus, central metabolism does not ensure the gluconeogenic growth of individual cells, but uses a population‐level adaptation resulting in responsive diversification upon nutrient changes.},

	Abstract = {High-quality quantitative data generated under standardized conditions is critical for understanding dynamic cellular processes. We report strategies for error reduction, and algorithms for automated data processing and for establishing the widely used techniques of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as highly precise methods for the quantification of protein levels and modifications. To determine the stoichiometry of cellular components and to ensure comparability of experiments, relative signals are converted to absolute values. A major source for errors in blotting techniques are inhomogeneities of the gel and the transfer procedure leading to correlated errors. These correlations are prevented by randomized gel loading, which significantly reduces standard deviations. Further error reduction is achieved by using housekeeping proteins as normalizers or by adding purified proteins in immunoprecipitations as calibrators in combination with criteria-based normalization. Additionally, we developed a computational tool for automated normalization, validation and integration of data derived from multiple immunoblots. In this way, large sets of quantitative data for dynamic pathway modeling can be generated, enabling the identification of systems properties and the prediction of targets for efficient intervention.},

	Abstract = {Directional guidance of cells via gradients of chemokines is considered crucial for embryonic development, cancer dissemination, and immune responses. Nevertheless, the concept still lacks direct experimental confirmation in vivo. Here, we identify endogenous gradients of the chemokine CCL21 within mouse skin and show that they guide dendritic cells toward lymphatic vessels. Quantitative imaging reveals depots of CCL21 within lymphatic endothelial cells and steeply decaying gradients within the perilymphatic interstitium. These gradients match the migratory patterns of the dendritic cells, which directionally approach vessels from a distance of up to 90-micrometers. Interstitial CCL21 is immobilized to heparan sulfates, and its experimental delocalization or swamping the endogenous gradients abolishes directed migration. These findings functionally establish the concept of haptotaxis, directed migration along immobilized gradients, in tissues.},

	Abstract = {The collective migration of cells in the form of cohesive tissues is a hallmark of both morphogenesis and repair. The extrinsic cues that direct these complex migrations usually act by regulating the dynamics of a specific subset of cells, those at the leading edge. Given that normally the function of tissue migration is to lay down multicellular structures, such as branched epithelial networks or sensory organs, it is surprising how little is known about the mechanisms that organize cells behind the leading edge. Cells of the zebrafish lateral line primordium switch from mesenchyme-like leader cells to epithelial rosettes that develop into mechanosensory organs. Here, we show that this transition is regulated by an Fgf signaling circuit that is active within the migrating primordium. Point sources of Fgf ligand drive surrounding cells towards a `non-leader' fate by increasing their epithelial character, a prerequisite for rosette formation. We demonstrate that the dynamic expression of Fgf ligands determines the spatiotemporal pattern of epithelialization underlying sensory organ formation in the lateral line. Furthermore, this work uncovers a surprising link between internal tissue organization and collective migration.},

	Abstract = {Biochips are physically and/or electronically controllable miniaturized labs. They are used for combinatorial chemical and biological analysis in environmental and medical studies. The precise positioning of the samples on the surface of the chip in picoliter to nanoliter volumes can be done either by means of external forces (active devices) or by specific geometric patterns (passive devices). The active devices which will be considered here are microfluidic biochips where the core of the technology are nanopumps featuring surface acoustic waves generated by electric pulses of high frequency. These waves propagate like a miniaturized earthquake, enter the fluid filled channels on top of the chip and cause an acoustic streaming in the fluid which provides the transport of the samples. The mathematical model represents a multiphysics problem consisting of the piezoelectric equations coupled with multiscale compressible Navier--Stokes equations that have to be treated by an appropriate homogenization. We discuss the modeling approach, present algorithmic tools for the numerical simulation and address optimal design issues. In particular, the optimal design of specific parts of the biochips leads to large-scale optimization problems. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we present a combination of domain decomposition and balanced truncation model reduction which allows explicit error bounds for the error between the reduced order and the fine-scale optimization problem. It is shown that this approach gives rise to a significant reduction of the problem size while maintaining the accuracy of the approximation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a numerical method for PDE-constrained optimization problems. These problems arise in many fields of science and engineering including those dealing with real applications. The physical problem is modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) and involve optimization of some quantity. The PDEs are in most cases nonlinear and solved using numerical methods. Since such numerical solutions are being used routinely, the recent trend has been to develop numerical methods and algorithms so that the optimization problems can be solved numerically as well using the same PDE-solver. We present here one such numerical method which is based on simultaneous pseudo-time stepping. The efficiency of the method is increased with the help of a multigrid strategy. Application example is included for an aerodynamic shape optimization problem.},

	Abstract = {Inferring knowledge about biological processes by a mathematical description is a major characteristic of Systems Biology. To understand and predict system's behavior the available experimental information is translated into a mathematical model. Since the availability of experimental data is often limited and measurements contain noise, it is essential to appropriately translate experimental uncertainty to model parameters as well as to model predictions. This is especially important in Systems Biology because typically large and complex models are applied and therefore the limited experimental knowledge might yield weakly specified model components.

	Abstract = {This work is devoted to an adaptive multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) for solving elliptic problems with rapidly oscillating coefficients. Starting from a general version of the MsFEM with oversampling, we derive an a posteriori estimate for the $H^1$-error between the exact solution of the problem and a corresponding MsFEM approximation. Our estimate holds without any assumptions on scale separation or on the type of the heterogeneity. The estimator splits into different contributions which account for the coarse grid error, the fine grid error, and the oversampling error. Based on the error estimate, we construct an adaptive algorithm that is validated in numerical experiments.

	Abstract = {This book presents a modern introduction of pde constrained optimization. It provides a precise functional analytic treatment via optimality conditions and a state-of-the-art, non-smooth algorithmical framework. Furthermore, new structure-exploiting discrete concepts and large scale, practically relevant applications are presented. The main focus is on the algorithmical and numerical treatment of pde constrained optimization problems on the infinite dimensional level. A particular emphasis is on simple constraints, such as pointwise bounds on controls and states. For these practically important situations, tailored Newton- and SQP-type solution algorithms are proposed and a general convergence framework is developed. This is complemented with the numerical analysis of structure-preserving Galerkin schemes for optimization problems with elliptic and parabolic equations. Finally, along with the optimization of semiconductor devices and the optimization of glass cooling processes, two challenging applications of pde constrained optimization are presented. They demonstrate the scope of this emerging research field for future engineering applications.},

@article{KaltenbacherKir2011,
	Abstract = {Parameter identification problems for partial differential equations usually lead to nonlinear inverse problems. A typical property of such problems is their instability, which requires regularization techniques, like, e.g., Tikhonov regularization. The main focus of this paper will be on efficient methods for determining a suitable regularization parameter by using adaptive finite element discretizations based on goal-oriented error estimators. A well-established method for the determination of a regularization parameter is the discrepancy principle where the residual norm, considered as a function i of the regularization parameter, should equal an appropriate multiple of the noise level. We suggest to solve the resulting scalar nonlinear equation by an inexact Newton method, where in each iteration step, a regularized problem is solved at a different discretization level. The proposed algorithm is an extension of the method suggested in Griesbaum A et al (2008 Inverse Problems 24 025025) for linear inverse problems, where goal-oriented error estimators for i and its derivative are used for adaptive refinement strategies in order to keep the discretization level as coarse as possible to save computational effort but fine enough to guarantee global convergence of the inexact Newton method. This concept leads to a highly efficient method for determining the Tikhonov regularization parameter for nonlinear ill-posed problems. Moreover, we prove that with the so-obtained regularization parameter and an also adaptively discretized Tikhonov minimizer, usual convergence and regularization results from the continuous setting can be recovered. As a matter of fact, it is shown that it suffices to use stationary points of the Tikhonov functional. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by means of numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {The Chemical Master Equation (CME) is a cornerstone of stochastic analysis and simulation of models of biochemical reaction networks. Yet direct solutions of the CME have remained elusive. Although several approaches overcome the infinite dimensional nature of the CME through projections or other means, a common feature of proposed approaches is their susceptibility to the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the exponential growth in memory and computational requirements in the number of problem dimensions. We present a novel approach that has the potential to ``lift'' this curse of dimensionality. The approach is based on the use of the recently proposed Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) formatted numerical linear algebra for the low parametric, numerical representation of tensors. The QTT decomposition admits both, algorithms for basic tensor arithmetics with complexity scaling linearly in the dimension (number of species) and sub- linearly in the mode size (maximum copy number), and a numerical tensor rounding procedure which is stable and quasi- optimal. We show how the CME can be represented in QTT format, then use the exponentially-converging hp-discontinuous Galerkin discretization in time to reduce the CME evolution problem to a set of QTT-structured linear equations to be solved at each time step using an algorithm based on Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) methods from quantum chemistry. Our method automatically adapts the ``basis'' of the solution at every time step guaranteeing that it is large enough to capture the dynamics of interest but no larger than necessary, as this would increase the computational complexity. Our approach is demonstrated by applying it to three different examples from systems biology: independent birth-death process, an example of enzymatic futile cycle, and a stochastic switch model. The numerical results on these examples demonstrate that the proposed QTT method achieves dramatic speedups and several orders of magnitude storage savings over direct approaches.},

	Abstract = {Tissue homeostasis in metazoans is regulated by transitions of cells between quiescence and prolifer- ation. The hallmark of proliferating populations is progression through the cell cycle, which is driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Here, we introduce a live-cell sensor for CDK2 activity and un- expectedly found that proliferating cells bifurcate into two populations as they exit mitosis. Many cells immediately commit to the next cell cycle by building up CDK2 activity from an intermediate level, while other cells lack CDK2 activity and enter a transient state of quiescence. This bifurcation is directly controlled by the CDK inhibitor p21 and is regulated by mitogens during a restriction window at the end of the previous cell cycle. Thus, cells decide at the end of mitosis to either start the next cell cycle by immediately building up CDK2 activity or to enter a transient G0-like state by suppressing CDK2 activity.

	Abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods perform inference on model-specific parameters of mechanistically motivated parametric statis- tical models when evaluating likelihoods is difficult. Central to the suc- cess of ABC methods is computationally inexpensive simulation of data sets from the parametric model of interest. However, when simulating data sets from a model is so computationally expensive that the posterior distribu- tion of parameters cannot be adequately sampled by ABC, inference is not straightforward. We present ``approximate approximate Bayesian computa- tion'' (AABC), a class of methods that extends simulation-based inference by ABC to models in which simulating data is expensive. In AABC, we first simulate a limited number of data sets that is computationally feasi- ble to simulate from the parametric model. We use these data sets as fixed background information to inform a non-mechanistic statistical model that approximates the correct parametric model and enables efficient simulation of a large number of data sets by Bayesian resampling methods. We show that under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution obtained by AABC converges to the posterior distribution obtained by ABC, as the number of data sets simulated from the parametric model and the sample size of the observed data set increase simultaneously. We illustrate the performance of AABC on a population-genetic model of natural selection, as well as on a model of the admixture history of hybrid populations.

	Abstract = {In view of solving theoretically constrained minimization problems, we investigate the properties of the gradient flows with respect to Hessian Riemannian metrics induced by Legendre functions. The first result characterizes Hessian Riemannian structures on convex sets as metrics that have a specific integration property with respect to variational inequalities, giving a new motivation for the introduction of Bregman-type distances. Then, the general evolution problem is introduced, and global convergence is established under quasi-convexity conditions, with interesting refinements in the case of convex minimization. Some explicit examples of these gradient flows are discussed. Dual trajectories are identified, and sufficient conditions for dual convergence are examined for a convex program with positivity and equality constraints. Some convergence rate results are established. In the case of a linear objective function, several optimality characterizations of the orbits are given: optimal path of viscosity methods, continuous-time model of Bregman-type proximal algorithms, geodesics for some adequate metrics, and projections of q ̇-trajectories of some Lagrange equations and completely integrable Hamiltonian systems.},

@article{PrigentBal2012,
	Abstract = {Protein polymerization consists in the aggregation of single monomers into polymers that may fragment. Fibrils assembly is a key process in amyloid diseases. Up to now, protein aggregation was commonly mathematically simulated by a polymer size-structured ordinary differential equations (ODE) system, which is infinite by definition and therefore leads to high computational costs. Moreover, this Ordinary Differential Equation-based modeling approach implies biological assumptions that may be difficult to justify in the general case. For example, whereas several ordinary differential equation models use the assumption that polymerization would occur at a constant rate independently of polymer size, it cannot be applied to certain protein aggregation mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel and efficient analytical method, capable of modelling and simulating amyloid aggregation processes. This alternative approach consists of an integro-Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model of coalescence-fragmentation type that was mathematically derived from the infinite differential system by asymptotic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of our approach, we applied it to aggregation experiments on polyglutamine polymers that are involved in Huntington's disease. Our model demonstrates the existence of a monomeric structural intermediate  acting as a nucleus and deriving from a non polymerizing monomer (). Furthermore, we compared our model to previously published works carried out in different contexts and proved its accuracy to describe other amyloid aggregation processes.},

@techreport{SchnoerrSan2014,
	Abstract = {Approximations based on moment-closure (MA) are commonly used to obtain estimates of the mean molecule numbers and of the variance of fluctuations in the number of molecules of chemical systems. The advantage of this approach is that it can be far less computationally expensive than exact stochastic simulations of the chemical master equation. Here we numerically study the conditions under which the MA equations yield results reflecting the true stochastic dynamics of the system. We show that for bistable and oscillatory chemical systems with deterministic initial conditions, the solution of the MA equations can be interpreted as a valid approximation to the true moments of the CME, only when the steady-state mean molecule numbers obtained from the chemical master equation fall within a certain finite range. The same validity criterion for monostable systems implies that the steady-state mean molecule numbers obtained from the chemical master equation must be above a certain threshold. For mean molecule numbers outside of this range of validity, the MA equations lead to either qualitatively wrong oscillatory dynamics or to unphysical predictions such as negative variances in the molecule numbers or multiple steady- state moments of the stationary distribution as the initial conditions are varied. Our results clarify the range of validity of the MA approach and show that pitfalls in the interpretation of the results can only be overcome through the systematic comparison of the solutions of the MA equations of a certain order with those of higher orders.},

	Abstract = {Model validation constitutes a fundamental step in data clustering. The central question is: Which cluster model and how many clusters are most appropriate for a certain application? In this study, we introduce a method for the validation of spectral clustering based upon approximation set coding. In particular, we compare correlation and pairwise clustering to analyze the correlations of temporal gene expression profiles. To evaluate and select clustering models, we calculate their reliable informativeness. Experimental results in the context of gene expression analysis show that pairwise clustering yields superior amounts of re- liable information. The analysis results are con- sistent with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and exhibit higher generality than BIC.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present some new results related to the higher order sigma point filter (HOSPoF), introduced in [1] for filtering nonlinear multivariate time series. This paper makes two distinct contributions. Firstly, we propose a new algorithm to generate a dis- crete statistical distribution to match exactly a specified mean vector, a specified covari- ance matrix, the average of specified marginal skewness and the average of specified marginal kurtosis. Both the sigma points and the probability weights are given in closed- form and no numerical optimization is required. Combined with HOSPoF, this random sigma point generation algorithm provides a new method for generating proposal density which propagates the information about higher order moments. A numerical example on nonlinear, multivariate time series involving real financial market data demonstrates the utility of this new algorithm. Secondly, we show that HOSPoF achieves a higher order esti- mation accuracy as compared to UKF for smooth scalar nonlinearities. We believe that this new filter provides a new and powerful alternative heuristic to existing filtering algorithms and is useful especially in econometrics and in engineering applications.},

	Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian computation have until recently been restricted to problems where the joint distribution of all variables has a density with respect to some fixed standard underlying measure. They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.},

@article{KrumsiekSuh2011,
	Abstract = {Background
With the advent of high-throughput targeted metabolic profiling techniques, the question of how to interpret and analyze the resulting vast amount of data becomes more and more important. In this work we address the reconstruction of metabolic reactions from cross-sectional metabolomics data, that is without the requirement for time-resolved measurements or specific system perturbations. Previous studies in this area mainly focused on Pearson correlation coefficients, which however are generally incapable of distinguishing between direct and indirect metabolic interactions.

Results
In our new approach we propose the application of a Gaussian graphical model (GGM), an undirected probabilistic graphical model estimating the conditional dependence between variables. GGMs are based on partial correlation coefficients, that is pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients conditioned against the correlation with all other metabolites. We first demonstrate the general validity of the method and its advantages over regular correlation networks with computer-simulated reaction systems. Then we estimate a GGM on data from a large human population cohort, covering 1020 fasting blood serum samples with 151 quantified metabolites. The GGM is much sparser than the correlation network, shows a modular structure with respect to metabolite classes, and is stable to the choice of samples in the data set. On the example of human fatty acid metabolism, we demonstrate for the first time that high partial correlation coefficients generally correspond to known metabolic reactions. This feature is evaluated both manually by investigating specific pairs of high-scoring metabolites, and then systematically on a literature-curated model of fatty acid synthesis and degradation. Our method detects many known reactions along with possibly novel pathway interactions, representing candidates for further experimental examination.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate strong signatures of intracellular pathways in blood serum data, and provide a valuable tool for the unbiased reconstruction of metabolic reactions from large-scale metabolomics data sets.},

	Abstract = {The protein kinase D (PKD) family consists of three serine/threonine protein kinases involved in the regulation of fundamental biological processes in response to their activation and intracellular redistribution. Although a substantial amount of information is available describing the mechanisms regulating the activation and intracellular distribution of the PKD isozymes during interphase, nothing is known of their activation status, localization and role during mitosis. The results presented in this study indicate that during mitosis, PKD3 and PKD are phosphorylated at Ser(731) and Ser(744) within their activation loop by a mechanism that requires protein kinase C. Mitosis-associated PKD3 Ser(731) and PKD Ser(744) phosphorylation is related to the catalytic activation of these kinases as evidenced by in vivo phosphorylation of histone deacetylase 5, a substrate of PKD and PKD3. Activation loop-phosphorylated PKD3 and PKD, as well as PKD2, associate with centrosomes, spindles and midbody suggesting that these activated kinases establish dynamic interactions with the mitotic apparatus. Thus, this study reveals a connection between the PKD isozymes and cell division, suggesting a novel role for this family of serine/threonine kinases.},

	Abstract = {Protein kinase D (PKD) is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases targeted by the second messenger diacylglycerol. It has been implicated in many important cellular processes and pathological conditions. However, further analysis of PKD in these processes is severely hampered by the lack of a PKD-specific inhibitor that can be readily applied to cells and in animal models. We now report the discovery of the first potent and selective cell-active small molecule inhibitor for PKD, benzoxoloazepinolone (CID755673). This inhibitor was identified from the National Institutes of Health small molecule repository library of 196,173 compounds using a human PKD1 (PKCmu)-based fluorescence polarization high throughput screening assay. CID755673 suppressed half of the PKD1 enzyme activity at 182 nm and exhibited selective PKD1 inhibition when compared with AKT, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), CDK activating kinase (CAK), CAMKIIalpha, and three different PKC isoforms. Moreover, it was not competitive with ATP for enzyme inhibition. In cell-based assays, CID755673 blocked phorbol ester-induced endogenous PKD1 activation in LNCaP cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Functionally, CID755673 inhibited the known biological actions of PKD1 including phorbol ester-induced class IIa histone deacetylase 5 nuclear exclusion, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and the ilimaquinone-induced Golgi fragmentation. Moreover, CID755673 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion. In summary, our findings indicate that CID755673 is a potent and selective PKD1 inhibitor with valuable pharmacological and cell biological potential.},

@article{LavalleBra2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein kinase D (PKD) has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes and pathological conditions including cancer. However, targeting PKD therapeutically and dissecting PKD-mediated cellular responses remains difficult due to lack of a potent and selective inhibitor. Previously, we identified a novel pan-PKD inhibitor, CID755673, with potency in the upper nanomolar range and high selectivity for PKD. In an effort to further enhance its selectivity and potency for potential in vivo application, small molecule analogs of CID755673 were generated by modifying both the core structure and side-chains.

RESULTS: After initial activity screening, five analogs with equal or greater potencies as CID755673 were chosen for further analysis: kb-NB142-70, kb-NB165-09, kb-NB165-31, kb-NB165-92, and kb-NB184-02. Our data showed that modifications to the aromatic core structure in particular significantly increased potency while retaining high specificity for PKD. When tested in prostate cancer cells, all compounds inhibited PMA-induced autophosphorylation of PKD1, with kb-NB142-70 being most active. Importantly, these analogs caused a dramatic arrest in cell proliferation accompanying elevated cytotoxicity when applied to prostate cancer cells. Cell migration and invasion were also inhibited by these analogs with varying potencies that correlated to their cellular activity.

CONCLUSIONS: Throughout the battery of experiments, the compounds kb-NB142-70 and kb-NB165-09 emerged as the most potent and specific analogs in vitro and in cells. These compounds are undergoing further testing for their effectiveness as pharmacological tools for dissecting PKD function and as potential anti-cancer agents in the treatment of prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {The compound U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1, 4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene) was identified as an inhibitor of AP-1 transactivation in a cell-based reporter assay. U0126 was also shown to inhibit endogenous promoters containing AP-1 response elements but did not affect genes lacking an AP-1 response element in their promoters. These effects of U0126 result from direct inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family members, MEK-1 and MEK-2. Inhibition is selective for MEK-1 and -2, as U0126 shows little, if any, effect on the kinase activities of protein kinase C, Abl, Raf, MEKK, ERK, JNK, MKK-3, MKK-4/SEK, MKK-6, Cdk2, or Cdk4. Comparative kinetic analysis of U0126 and the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (Dudley, D. T., Pang, L., Decker, S. J., Bridges, A. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 92, 7686-7689) demonstrates that U0126 and PD098059 are noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to both MEK substrates, ATP and ERK. We further demonstrate that the two compounds bind to deltaN3-S218E/S222D MEK in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that they may share a common or overlapping binding site(s). Quantitative evaluation of the steady state kinetics of MEK inhibition by these compounds reveals that U0126 has approximately 100-fold higher affinity for deltaN3-S218E/S222D MEK than does PD098059. We further tested the effects of these compounds on the activity of wild type MEK isolated after activation from stimulated cells. Surprisingly, we observe a significant diminution in affinity of both compounds for wild type MEK as compared with the deltaN3-S218E/S222D mutant enzyme. These results suggest that the affinity of both compounds is mediated by subtle conformational differences between the two activated MEK forms. The MEK affinity of U0126, its selectivity for MEK over other kinases, and its cellular efficacy suggest that this compound will serve as a powerful tool for in vitro and cellular investigations of mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signal transduction.},

	Abstract = {Cell responses are actuated by tightly controlled signal transduction pathways. Although the concept of an integrated signaling network replete with interpathway cross-talk and feedback regulation is broadly appreciated, kinetic data of the type needed to characterize such interactions in conjunction with mathematical models are lacking. In mammalian cells, the Ras/ERK pathway controls cell proliferation and other responses stimulated by growth factors, and several cross-talk and feedback mechanisms affecting its activation have been identified. In this work, we take a systematic approach to parse the magnitudes of multiple regulatory mechanisms that attenuate ERK activation through canonical (Ras-dependent) and non-canonical (PI3K-dependent) pathways. In addition to regulation of receptor and ligand levels, we consider three layers of ERK-dependent feedback: desensitization of Ras activation, negative regulation of MEK kinase (e.g. Raf) activities, and up-regulation of dual-specificity ERK phosphatases. Our results establish the second of these as the dominant mode of ERK self-regulation in mouse fibroblasts. We further demonstrate that kinetic models of signaling networks, trained on a sufficient diversity of quantitative data, can be reasonably comprehensive, accurate, and predictive in the dynamical sense.},

	Abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is comprised of a three-tiered kinase cascade. The distributive kinetic mechanism of two-site MAP kinase phosphorylation inherently generates a nonlinear switch-like response. However, a linear graded response of MAP kinase has also been observed in mammalian cells, and its molecular mechanism remains unclear. To dissect these input-output behaviors, we quantitatively measured the kinetic parameters involved in the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)-ERK MAP kinase signaling module in HeLa cells. Using a numerical analysis based on experimentally determined parameters, we predicted in silico and validated in vivo that ERK is processively phosphorylated in HeLa cells. Finally, we identified molecular crowding as a critical factor that converts distributive phosphorylation into processive phosphorylation. We proposed the term quasi-processive phosphorylation to describe this mode of ERK phosphorylation that is operated under the physiological condition of molecular crowding. The generality of this phenomenon may provide a new paradigm for a diverse set of biochemical reactions including multiple posttranslational modifications.},

	Abstract = {The 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of proteins is a group of highly conserved Ser/Thr kinases that regulate diverse cellular processes, such as cell growth, cell motility, cell survival and cell proliferation. RSKs are downstream effectors of the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade. Significant advances in the field of RSK and ERK/MAPK signalling have occurred in the past few years, including biological insights and the discovery of novel substrates and new RSK regulatory mechanisms. Collectively, these data expand the current models of RSK signalling and highlight potential directions of research in RSK-mediated survival, growth, proliferation and migration.},

	Abstract = {The specificities of 65 compounds reported to be relatively specific inhibitors of protein kinases have been profiled against a panel of 70-80 protein kinases. On the basis of this information, the effects of compounds that we have studied in cells and other data in the literature, we recommend the use of the following small-molecule inhibitors: SB 203580/SB202190 and BIRB 0796 to be used in parallel to assess the physiological roles of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) isoforms, PI-103 and wortmannin to be used in parallel to inhibit phosphatidylinositol (phosphoinositide) 3-kinases, PP1 or PP2 to be used in parallel with Src-I1 (Src inhibitor-1) to inhibit Src family members; PD 184352 or PD 0325901 to inhibit MKK1 (MAPK kinase-1) or MKK1 plus MKK5, Akt-I-1/2 to inhibit the activation of PKB (protein kinase B/Akt), rapamycin to inhibit TORC1 [mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) complex], CT 99021 to inhibit GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), BI-D1870 and SL0101 or FMK (fluoromethylketone) to be used in parallel to inhibit RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase), D4476 to inhibit CK1 (casein kinase 1), VX680 to inhibit Aurora kinases, and roscovitine as a pan-CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor. We have also identified harmine as a potent and specific inhibitor of DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase 1A) in vitro. The results have further emphasized the need for considerable caution in using small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases to assess the physiological roles of these enzymes. Despite being used widely, many of the compounds that we analysed were too non-specific for useful conclusions to be made, other than to exclude the involvement of particular protein kinases in cellular processes.},

	Abstract = {Kinase inhibitors are a new class of therapeutics with a propensity to inhibit multiple targets. The biological consequences of multi-kinase activity are poorly defined, and an important step toward understanding the relationship between selectivity, efficacy and safety is the exploration of how inhibitors interact with the human kinome. We present interaction maps for 38 kinase inhibitors across a panel of 317 kinases representing >50% of the predicted human protein kinome. The data constitute the most comprehensive study of kinase inhibitor selectivity to date and reveal a wide diversity of interaction patterns. To enable a global analysis of the results, we introduce the concept of a selectivity score as a general tool to quantify and differentiate the observed interaction patterns. We further investigate the impact of panel size and find that small assay panels do not provide a robust measure of selectivity.},

@article{RybinGuo2009,
	Abstract = {Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a physiologically important signaling enzyme that is activated via protein kinase C-dependent trans-phosphorylation of the activation loop at Ser744 and Ser748 followed by PKD1 autophosphorylation at Ser916. Although PKD-Ser916 autophosphorylation is widely used to track cellular PKD activity, this study exposes conditions leading to increased PKD-Ser(P)916 immunoreactivity without an associated increase in PKD activity in cardiomyocytes that heterologously overexpress catalytically inactive PKD1 and in cardiomyocytes treated with G{\"o}6976 (a PKD inhibitor that competes with ATP). In each case, PKD1 is detected as a Ser916-phosphorylated enzyme that lacks kinase activity. In vitro kinase assays reconcile these seemingly discrepant findings by demonstrating that PKD1-Ser916 autophosphorylation can proceed via either an intermolecular reaction or an intramolecular autophosphorylation that requires only very low ATP concentrations that do not support target substrate phosphorylation. Additional studies show that Ser744 and Ser748 are targets for a protein kinase C-independent autocatalytic phosphorylation and that the PKD1-S744A/S748A mutant is a Ser916-phosphorylated enzyme that is not active toward heterologous substrates. In contrast, PKD1-S916A is an active kinase that autophosphorylates at Ser744. However, the S916A substitution leads to a Ser748 phosphorylation defect and a prolonged cellular PKD1 signaling response. Collectively, these results implicate PKD1-Ser744 phosphorylation in the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent mechanism that increases PKD1 activity toward physiologically relevant substrates. We show that PKD1-Ser916 autophosphorylation does not necessarily correlate with PKD1 activity. Rather, autophosphorylation at Ser916 is required for subsequent autophosphorylation at Ser748. Finally, this study exposes a novel role for Ser916 and/or Ser748 autophosphorylation to terminate the cellular PKD1 signaling response.},

	Abstract = {Before entering mitosis, the stacks of the Golgi cisternae are separated from each other, and inhibiting this process delays entry of mammalian cells into mitosis. Protein kinase D (PKD) is known to be involved in Golgi-to--cell surface transport by controlling the biogenesis of specific transport carriers. Here we show that depletion of PKD1 and PKD2 proteins from HeLa cells by small interfering RNA leads to the accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and prevents cells from entering mitosis. We further provide evidence that inhibition of PKD blocks mitotic Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activation, and, as a consequence, mitotic Golgi fragmentation, which could be rescued by expression of active MEK1. Finally, Golgi fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analy- ses demonstrate that PKD is crucial for the cleavage of the noncompact zones of Golgi mem- branes in G2 phase. Our findings suggest that PKD controls interstack Golgi connections in a Raf-1/MEK1--dependent manner, a process required for entry of the cells into mitosis.},

	Abstract = {EGF-induced activation of ERK has been extensively studied by both experimental and theoretical approaches. Here, we used a simulation model based mostly on experimentally determined parameters to study the ERK-mediated negative feedback regulation of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, son of sevenless (SOS). Because SOS1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues upon stimulation, we evaluated the role of the multiplicity by build- ing two simulation models, which we termed the decisive and coop- erative phosphorylation models. The two models were constrained by the duration of Ras activation and basal phosphorylation level of SOS1. Possible solutions were found only in the decisive model wherein at least three, and probably more than four, phosphoryla- tion sites decisively suppress the SOS activity. Thus, the combina- tion of experimental approaches and the model analysis has suggested an unexpected role of multiple phosphorylations of SOS1 in the negative regulation.},

	Abstract = {Noise in gene expression can lead to reversible phenotypic switching. Several experimental studies have shown that the abundance distributions of proteins in a population of isogenic cells may display multiple distinct maxima. Each of these maxima may be associated with a subpopulation of a particular phenotype, the quantification of which is important for understanding cellular decision-making. Here, we devise a methodology which allows us to quantify multimodal gene expression distributions and single-cell power spectra in gene regulatory networks. Extending the commonly used linear noise approximation, we rigorously show that, in the limit of slow promoter dynamics, these distributions can be systematically approximated as a mixture of Gaussian components in a wide class of networks. The resulting closed-form approximation provides a practical tool for studying complex nonlinear gene regulatory networks that have thus far been amenable only to stochastic simulation. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a number of genetic networks, uncovering previously unidentified dynamical characteristics associated with phenotypic switching. Specifically, we elucidate how the interplay of transcriptional and translational regulation can be exploited to control the multimodality of gene expression distributions in two-promoter networks. We demonstrate how phenotypic switching leads to birhythmical expression in a genetic oscillator, and to hysteresis in phenotypic induction, thus highlighting the ability of regulatory networks to retain memory.},

	Abstract = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood disease that disrupts normal function of the hematopoietic system. Despite the great progress made in terms of molecular therapies for CML, there remain large gaps in our understanding. By comparing mathematical models that describe CML progression and etiology we sought to identify those models that provide the best description of disease dynamics and their underlying mechanisms. Data for two clinical outcomes--- disease remission or relapse---are considered, and we investigate these using Bayesian inference techniques throughout. We find that it is not possible to choose between the models based on fits to the data alone; however, by studying model predictions we can discard models that fail to take niche effects into account. More detailed analysis of the remaining models reveals mechanistic differences: for one model, leu- kemia stem cell dynamics determine the disease outcome; and for the other model disease progression is determined at the stage of progen- itor cells, in particular by differences in progenitor death rates. This analysis also reveals distinct transient dynamics that will be experi- mentally accessible, but are currently at the limits of what is possible to measure. To resolve these differences we need to be able to probe the hematopoietic stem cell niche directly. Our analysis highlights the importance of further mapping of the bone marrow hematopoietic niche microenvironment as the ``ecological'' interactions between cells in this niche appear to be intricately linked to disease outcome.},

	Abstract = {The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its cell membrane receptors constitute an elaborate signaling system fulfilling important functions in immune regulation and tumor surveillance. Activation of the death receptors TRAILR1 and TRAILR2 can lead to apoptosis, whereas TRAILR3 and TRAILR4 are generally referred to as decoy receptors, which have been shown to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Alike other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, TRAIL receptors contain a pre-ligand binding assembly domain (PLAD) mediating receptor oligomerization. Still, the stoichiometry of TRAIL receptor oligomers as well as the issue whether the PLAD mediates only homotypic or also heterotypic interactions, remained inconclusive until now. Performing acceptor- photobleaching FRET studies with receptors 1, 2 and 4 we demonstrate interactions in all possible combinations. Formation of dimers was shown by chemical crosslinking experiments for interactions of TRAILR2 and heterophilic interactions between the two death receptors or between either of the death receptors and TRAILR4. Implications of the demonstrated receptor-receptor interactions on signaling were investigated in suitable cellular models. Both, apoptosis induction and activation of the transcription factor NFκB were significantly reduced in presence of TRAILR4. Our experimental data combined with mathematical modeling, show that the inhibitory capacity of TRAILR4 is attributable to signaling-independent mechanisms, strongly suggesting a reduction of signaling competent death receptors through formation heteromeric receptor complexes.

	Abstract = {Mass cytometry facilitates high-dimensional, quantitative analysis of the effects of bioactive molecules on human samples at single-cell resolution, but instruments process only one sample at a time. Here we describe mass-tag cellular barcoding (MCB), which increases mass cytometry throughput by using n metal ion tags to multiplex up to 2n samples. We used seven tags to multiplex an entire 96-well plate, and applied MCB to characterize human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) signaling dynamics and cell-to-cell communication, signaling variability between PBMCs from eight human donors, and the effects of 27 inhibitors on this system. For each inhibitor, we measured 14 phosphorylation sites in 14 PBMC types at 96 conditions, resulting in 18,816 quantified phosphorylation levels from each multiplexed sample. This high-dimensional, systems-level inquiry allowed analysis across cell-type and signaling space, reclassified inhibitors and revealed off-target effects. High-content, high-throughput screening with MCB should be useful for drug discovery, preclinical testing and mechanistic investigation of human disease.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the scaled unscented transformation, a new method of applying the unscented transform to a nonlinear system. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian) probability distribution. Each point in the set is scaled by a user-specified constant. A method is derived which preserves the second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving performance as good as second order truncated filter. 1 Introduction One of the most fundamental tasks in filtering and estimation is to calculate the statistics of a random variable that has undergone a transformation. When the system models are non-linear no general closed-form solutions exist [11] and many approximations have been proposed [1-3, 12, 13]. In [7] and [9] we introduced a new approximate method for propagating means and covariances through nonlinear transformations called the unscented transformation. A set of weighted sigma points are deterministical.},

@article{ToniTid2013,
	Abstract = {Biological systems are inherently variable, with their dynamics influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic sources. These systems are often only partially characterized, with large uncertainties about specific sources of extrinsic variability and biochemical properties. Moreover, it is not yet well understood how different sources of variability combine and affect biological systems in concert. To successfully design biomedical therapies or synthetic circuits with robust performance, it is crucial to account for uncertainty and effects of variability. Here we introduce an efficient modeling and simulation framework to study systems that are simultaneously subject to multiple sources of variability, and apply it to make design decisions on small genetic networks that play a role of basic design elements of synthetic circuits. Specifically, the framework was used to explore the effect of transcriptional and post-transcriptional autoregulation on fluctuations in protein expression in simple genetic networks. We found that autoregulation could either suppress or increase the output variability, depending on specific noise sources and network parameters. We showed that transcriptional autoregulation was more successful than post-transcriptional in suppressing variability across a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic magnitudes and sources. We derived the following design principles to guide the design of circuits that best suppress variability: (i) high protein cooperativity and low miRNA cooperativity, (ii) imperfect complementarity between miRNA and mRNA was preferred to perfect complementarity, and (iii) correlated expression of mRNA and miRNA -- for example, on the same transcript -- was best for suppression of protein variability. Results further showed that correlations in kinetic parameters between cells affected the ability to suppress variability, and that variability in transient states did not necessarily follow the same principles as variability in the steady state. Our model and findings provide a general framework to guide design principles in synthetic biology.},

	Abstract = {Cell behaviour and the cellular environment are stochastic. Phenotypes vary across isogenic populations and in individual cells over time. Here we will argue that to understand the abilities of cells we need to understand their stochastic nature. New experimental techniques allow gene expression to be followed in single cells over time and reveal stochastic bursts of both mRNA and protein synthesis in many different types of organisms. Stochasticity has been shown to be exploited by bacteria and viruses to decide between different behaviours. In fluctuating environments, cells that respond stochastically can out-compete those that sense environmental changes, and stochasticity may even have contributed to chromosomal gene order. We will focus on advances in modelling stochasticity, in understanding its effects on evolution and cellular design, and on means by which it may be exploited in biotechnology and medicine.},

	Abstract = {Cellular information processing requires the coordinated activity of a large network of intracellular signalling pathways. Cross- talk between pathways provides for complex non-linear responses to combinations of stimuli, but little is known about the density of these interactions in any specific cell. Here, we have analysed a large-scale survey of pathway interactions carried out by the Alliance for Cellular Signalling (AfCS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Twenty-two receptor-specific ligands were studied, both alone and in all pairwise combinations, for Ca2+ mobilization, cAMP synthesis, phosphorylation of many signalling proteins and for cytokine production. A large number of non-additive interactions are evident that are consistent with known mechanisms of cross-talk between pathways, but many novel interactions are also revealed. A global analysis of cross-talk suggests that many external stimuli converge on a relatively small number of interaction mechanisms to provide for context-dependent signalling.},

	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	Abstract = {Biological processes exhibiting stochastic fluctuations are mainly modeled using the Chemical Master Equation (CME). As a direct simulation of the CME is often computationally intractable, we recently introduced the Method of Conditional Moments (MCM). The MCM is a hybrid approach to approximate the statistics of the CME solution. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive formulation of the MCM by using non-central conditional moments instead of central conditional moments. The modified formulation allows for additional insight into the model structure and for extensions to higher-order reactions and non-polynomial propensity functions. The properties of the non-central MCM are analyzed using a model for the regulation of pili formation on the surface of bacteria, which possesses rational propensity functions.},

	Abstract = {The extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway controls cell proliferation and differentiation in metazoans. Two hallmarks of its dynamics are adaptation of ERK phosphorylation, which has been linked to negative feedback, and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which allows active ERK to phosphorylate protein substrates in the nucleus and cytosol. To integrate these complex features, we acquired quantitative biochemical and live‐cell microscopy data to reconcile phosphorylation, localization, and activity states of ERK. While maximal growth factor stimulation elicits transient ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation responses, ERK activities available to phosphorylate substrates in the cytosol and nuclei show relatively little or no adaptation. Free ERK activity in the nucleus temporally lags the peak in nuclear translocation, indicating a slow process. Additional experiments, guided by kinetic modeling, show that this process is consistent with ERK's modification of and release from nuclear substrate anchors. Thus, adaptation of whole‐cell ERK phosphorylation is a by‐product of transient protection from phosphatases. Consistent with this interpretation, predictions concerning the dose‐dependence of the pathway response and its interruption by inhibition of MEK were experimentally confirmed.},

	Abstract = {Ever since reversible protein phosphorylation was discovered, it has been clear that it plays a key role in the regulation of cellular processes. Proteins often undergo double phosphorylation, which can occur through two possible mechanisms: distributive or processive. Which phosphorylation mechanism is chosen for a particular cellular regulation bears biological significance, and it is therefore in our interest to understand these mechanisms. In this paper we study dynamics of the MEK/ERK phosphorylation. We employ a model selection algorithm based on approximate Bayesian computation to elucidate phosphorylation dynamics from quantitative time course data obtained from PC12 cells in vivo. The algorithm infers the posterior distribution over four proposed models for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation dynamics, and this distribution indicates the amount of support given to each model. We evaluate the robustness of our inferential framework by systematically exploring different ways of parameterizing the models and for different prior specifications. The models with the highest inferred posterior probability are the two models employing distributive dephosphorylation, whereas we are unable to choose decisively between the processive and distributive phosphorylation mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {To comprehend the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade, which comprises Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK, several kinetic simulation models have been developed. However, a large number of parameters that are essential for the development of these models are still missing and need to be set arbitrarily. Here, we aimed at collecting these missing parameters using fluorescent probes. First, the levels of the signaling molecules were quantitated. Second, to monitor both the activation and nuclear translocation of ERK, we developed probes based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Third, the dissociation constants of Ras.Raf, Raf.MEK, and MEK.ERK complexes were estimated using a fluorescent tag that can be highlighted very rapidly. Finally, the same fluorescent tag was used to measure the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling rates of ERK and MEK. Using these parameters, we developed a kinetic simulation model consisting of the minimum essential members of the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade. This simple model reproduced essential features of the observed activation and nuclear translocation of ERK. In this model, the concentration of Raf significantly affected the levels of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK upon stimulation. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by decreasing the level of Raf using the small interfering RNA technique. This observation verified the usefulness of the parameters collected in this study.},

	Abstract = {To elucidate the hidden dynamics of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling networks, we developed a simulation model of ERK signalling networks by constraining in silico dynamics based on in vivo dynamics in PC12 cells. We predicted and validated that transient ERK activation depends on rapid increases of epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (NGF) but not on their final concentrations, whereas sustained ERK activation depends on the final concentration of NGF but not on the temporal rate of increase. These ERK dynamics depend on Ras and Rap1 dynamics, the inactivation processes of which are growth-factor-dependent and -independent, respectively. Therefore, the Ras and Rap1 systems capture the temporal rate and concentration of growth factors, and encode these distinct physical properties into transient and sustained ERK activation, respectively.},

	Abstract = {To predict the emergence of antibiotic resistance, quantitative relations must be established between the fitness of drug-resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. These relations are often unknown and may depend on the state of bacterial growth. To bridge this gap, we have investigated Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.},

Image-based modeling and simulation aims at using systematic, quantitative image data to build predictive models of biological systems that can be simulated with a computer. This allows one to disentangle molecular mechanisms from effects of shape and geometry. Questions like "what is the functional role of shape" or "how are biological shapes generated and regulated" can be addressed in the framework of image-based systems biology. The combination of image quantification, model building, and computer simulation is illustrated here using the example of diffusion in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

	Abstract = {Chemical reaction systems with a low to moderate number of molecules are typically modeled as discrete jump Markov processes. These systems are oftentimes simulated with methods that produce statistically exact sample paths such as the Gillespie algorithm or the next reaction method. In this paper we make explicit use of the fact that the initiation times of the reactions can be represented as the firing times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes with internal times given by integrated propensity functions. Using this representation we derive a modified next reaction method and, in a way that achieves efficiency over existing approaches for exact simulation, extend it to systems with time dependent propensities as well as to systems with delays.},

	Abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become an essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Grelaud et al. [(2009) Bayesian Anal 3:427--442] advocated the use of ABC for model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on an intermodel sufficiency property to show that the approximation was legitimate. We implemented ABC model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the Do It Yourself-ABC (DIY-ABC) software [Cornuet et al. (2008) Bioinformatics 24:2713--2719]. We now present arguments as to why the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing, because the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIY-ABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25--50:1, and to 100--200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

	Abstract = {Flow cytometry bioinformatics is the application of bioinformatics to flow cytometry data, which involves storing, retrieving, organizing, and analyzing flow cytometry data using extensive computational resources and tools. Flow cytometry bioinformatics requires extensive use of and contributes to the development of techniques from computational statistics and machine learning. Flow cytometry and related methods allow the quantification of multiple independent biomarkers on large numbers of single cells. The rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data, particularly in the 2000s, has led to the creation of a variety of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public databases for the sharing of results. Computational methods exist to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data, identifying cell populations within it, matching those cell populations across samples, and performing diagnosis and discovery using the results of previous steps. For preprocessing, this includes compensating for spectral overlap, transforming data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis, assessing data for quality, and normalizing data across samples and experiments. For population identification, tools are available to aid traditional manual identification of populations in two-dimensional scatter plots (gating), to use dimensionality reduction to aid gating, and to find populations automatically in higher dimensional space in a variety of ways. It is also possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways, such as the density-guided binary space partitioning technique known as probability binning, or by combinatorial gating. Finally, diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by supervised learning techniques, and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned methods.

Open standards, data, and software are also key parts of flow cytometry bioinformatics. Data standards include the widely adopted Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) defining how data from cytometers should be stored, but also several new standards under development by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) to aid in storing more detailed information about experimental design and analytical steps. Open data is slowly growing with the opening of the CytoBank database in 2010 and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely distribute their data, and the latter of which has been recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant data by ISAC. Open software is most widely available in the form of a suite of Bioconductor packages, but is also available for web execution on the GenePattern platform.},

	Abstract = {Cellular decision-making is mediated by a complex interplay of external stimuli with the intracellular environment, in particular transcription factor regulatory networks. Here we have determined the expression of a network of 18 key haematopoietic transcription factors in 597 single primary blood stem and progenitor cells isolated from mouse bone marrow. We demonstrate that different stem/progenitor populations are characterized by distinctive transcription factor expression states, and through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis reveal positively and negatively correlated transcription factor pairings, including previously unrecognized relationships between Gata2, Gfi1 and Gfi1b. Validation using transcriptional and transgenic assays confirmed direct regulatory interactions consistent with a regulatory triad in immature blood stem cells, where Gata2 may function to modulate cross-inhibition between Gfi1 and Gfi1b. Single-cell expression profiling therefore identifies network states and allows reconstruction of network hierarchies involved in controlling stem cell fate choices, and provides a blueprint for studying both normal development and human disease.},

	Abstract = {Many forms of cancer have multiple subtypes with different causes and clinical outcomes. Somatic tumor genome sequences provide a rich new source of data for uncovering these subtypes but have proven difficult to compare, as two tumors rarely share the same mutations. Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.},

	Abstract = {Determining how somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) promote cancer is an important goal. We characterized SCNA patterns in 4,934 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer data set. Whole-genome doubling, observed in 37% of cancers, was associated with higher rates of every other type of SCNA, TP53 mutations, CCNE1 amplifications and alterations of the PPP2R complex. SCNAs that were internal to chromosomes tended to be shorter than telomere-bounded SCNAs, suggesting different mechanisms underlying their generation. Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation. When levels of genomic disruption were accounted for, 7% of region pairs were anticorrelated, and these regions tended to encompass genes whose proteins physically interact, suggesting related functions. These results provide insights into mechanisms of generation and functional consequences of cancer-related SCNAs.},

	Abstract = {Functional cell-to-cell variability is ubiquitous in multicellular organisms as well as bacterial populations. Even genetically identical cells of the same cell type can respond differently to identical stimuli. Methods have been developed to analyse heterogeneous populations, e.g., mixture models and stochastic population models. The available methods are, however, either incapable of simultaneously analysing different experimental conditions or are computationally demanding and difficult to apply. Furthermore, they do not account for biological information available in the literature. To overcome disadvantages of existing methods, we combine mixture models and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The ODE models provide a mechanistic description of the underlying processes while mixture models provide an easy way to capture variability. In a simulation study, we show that the class of ODE constrained mixture models can unravel the subpopulation structure and determine the sources of cell-to-cell variability. In addition, the method provides reliable estimates for kinetic rates and subpopulation characteristics. We use ODE constrained mixture modelling to study NGF-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in primary sensory neurones, a process relevant in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We propose a mechanistic pathway model for this process and reconstructed static and dynamical subpopulation characteristics across experimental conditions. We validate the model predictions experimentally, which verifies the capabilities of ODE constrained mixture models. These results illustrate that ODE constrained mixture models can reveal novel mechanistic insights and possess a high sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {The problem of controlling a high-dimensional linear system subject to hard input and state constraints using model predictive control is considered. Applying model predictive control to high-dimensional systems typically leads to a prohibitive computational complexity. Therefore, reduced order models are employed in many applications. This introduces an approximation error which may deteriorate the closed loop behavior and may even lead to instability. We propose a novel model predictive control scheme using a reduced order model for prediction in combination with an error bounding system. We employ the explicit time and input dependent bound on the model order reduction error to achieve design conditions for constraint fulfillment, recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability for the closed loop of the model predictive controller when applied to the high-dimensional system. Moreover, for a special choice of design parameters, we establish local optimality of the proposed model predictive control scheme. The proposed MPC approach is assessed via examples demonstrating that a good trade-off between computational efficiency and conservatism can be achieved while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction and asymptotic stability.},

	Abstract = {The quantitative effects of environmental and genetic perturbations on metabolism can be studied in silico using kinetic models. We present a strategy for large-scale model construction based on a logical layering of data such as reaction fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and kinetic constants. The resulting models contain realistic standard rate laws and plausible parameters, adhere to the laws of thermodynamics, and reproduce a predefined steady state. These features have not been simultaneously achieved by previous workflows. We demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the workflow by translating the yeast consensus metabolic network into a kinetic model. Despite crudely selected data, the model shows realistic control behaviour, a stable dynamic, and realistic response to perturbations in extracellular glucose concentrations. The paper concludes by outlining how new data can continuously be fed into the workflow and how iterative model building can assist in directing experiments.},

	Abstract = {Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is produced by and affects a number of immune and inflammatory cells. As part of the inflammatory response, NGF directly or indirectly alters the sensitivity of small diameter sensory neurons that communicate noxious information. The question remains as to the receptors and intracellular signaling cascades that mediate this sensitizing action of NGF. Although the general consensus is that NGF produces peripheral sensitization by activating TrkA, recent work suggests that p75 also contributes. Thus, both NGF receptors appear to contribute to peripheral sensitization although whether they act independently or together remains to be determined. Furthermore, controversy exists as to the downstream signaling pathways involved in NGF-induced peripheral sensitization.},

	Abstract = {Biosynthetic latency in early stages of deoxyribonucleic acid transformation in Bacillus subtilis. J. Bacteriol. 86:785-796. 1963-In the Bacillus subtilis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transformation system, transformants do not increase in number for 3 to 5 hr after the addition of DNA. During most of this period, the transformants are resistant to the bactericidal action of penicillin under conditions which result in the killing of over 90% of the recipient population. This lag in growth and nonmultiplication of the transformants (inferred from penicillin resistance) is also reflected in a lag in the synthesis of an enzyme specified by the donor DNA. Thus, when a cell population deficient in the enzyme tryptophan synthetase is transformed to tryptophan independence, activity of this enzyme cannot be detected in whole cells until 3 to 4 hr after the cells have been exposed to the DNA. Recombination between donor and recipient DNA occurs long before this. Even 30 min after exposure of a competent population of try(2) (-)his(2) (+) cells to try(2) (+)his(2) (-) DNA, 20% of the total try(2) (+) activity found in re-extracted DNA exists as recombinant DNA, try(2) (+)his(2) (+). This value, the maximal linkage obtained, remains constant during incubation of the DNA-treated culture for an additional 5 hr. In addition to the heterogeneous response of a DNA-treated competent culture to penicillin killing, the recipient culture appears to be heterogeneous in ability to undergo transformation. Thus, the frequency of joint transformation of two unlinked markers is much higher than would be expected on the basis of the random coincidence of more than one DNA molecule entering the same cell in a uniformly competent recipient population. A possible relationship between these two aspects of heterogeneity of a DNA-treated recipient population is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

	Abstract = {The ErbB signaling pathways, which regulate diverse physiological responses such as cell survival, proliferation and motility, have been subjected to extensive molecular analysis. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood how different ligands induce different responses and how this is affected by oncogenic mutations. To quantify signal flow through ErbB-activated pathways we have constructed, trained and analyzed a mass action model of immediate-early signaling involving ErbB1-4 receptors (EGFR, HER2/Neu2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt cascades. We find that parameter sensitivity is strongly dependent on the feature (e.g. ERK or Akt activation) or condition (e.g. EGF or heregulin stimulation) under examination and that this context dependence is informative with respect to mechanisms of signal propagation. Modeling predicts log-linear amplification so that significant ERK and Akt activation is observed at ligand concentrations far below the K(d) for receptor binding. However, MAPK and Akt modules isolated from the ErbB model continue to exhibit switch-like responses. Thus, key system-wide features of ErbB signaling arise from nonlinear interaction among signaling elements, the properties of which appear quite different in context and in isolation.},

In the KEGG DISEASE database, each disease is represented by a list of known disease genes, any known environmental factors at the molecular level, diagnostic markers and therapeutic drugs, which may reflect the underlying molecular system. The KEGG DRUG database contains chemical structures and/or chemical components of all drugs in Japan, including crude drugs and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) formulas, and drugs in the USA and Europe. This database also captures knowledge about two types of molecular networks: the interaction network with target molecules, metabolizing enzymes, other drugs, etc. and the chemical structure transformation network in the history of drug development.

	Abstract = {Due to the high complexity of biological data it is difficult to disentangle cellular processes relying only on intuitive interpretation of measurements. A Systems Biology approach that combines quantitative experimental data with dynamic mathematical modeling promises to yield deeper insights into these processes. Nevertheless, with growing complexity and increasing amount of quantitative experimental data, building realistic and reliable mathematical models can become a challenging task: the quality of experimental data has to be assessed objectively, unknown model parameters need to be estimated from the experimental data, and numerical calculations need to be precise and efficient.

Here, we discuss, compare and characterize the performance of computational methods throughout the process of quantitative dynamic modeling using two previously established examples, for which quantitative, dose- and time-resolved experimental data are available. In particular, we present an approach that allows to determine the quality of experimental data in an efficient, objective and automated manner. Using this approach data generated by different measurement techniques and even in single replicates can be reliably used for mathematical modeling. For the estimation of unknown model parameters, the performance of different optimization algorithms was compared systematically. Our results show that deterministic derivative-based optimization employing the sensitivity equations in combination with a multi-start strategy based on latin hypercube sampling outperforms the other methods by orders of magnitude in accuracy and speed. Finally, we investigated transformations that yield a more efficient parameterization of the model and therefore lead to a further enhancement in optimization performance. We provide a freely available open source software package that implements the algorithms and examples compared here.},

	Abstract = {Cancer therapy is challenged by the diversity of molecular implementations of oncogenic processes and by the resulting variation in therapeutic responses. Projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provide molecular tumor maps in unprecedented detail. The interpretation of these maps remains a major challenge. Here we distilled thousands of genetic and epigenetic features altered in cancers to ~500 selected functional events (SFEs). Using this simplified description, we derived a hierarchical classification of 3,299 TCGA tumors from 12 cancer types. The top classes are dominated by either mutations (M class) or copy number changes (C class). This distinction is clearest at the extremes of genomic instability, indicating the presence of different oncogenic processes. The full hierarchy shows functional event patterns characteristic of multiple cross-tissue groups of tumors, termed oncogenic signature classes. Targetable functional events in a tumor class are suggestive of class-specific combination therapy. These results may assist in the definition of clinical trials to match actionable oncogenic signatures with personalized therapies.},

	Abstract = {Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is widely used in immunology to detect cell division, and several mathematical models have been proposed to estimate proliferation and death rates of lymphocytes from BrdU labelling and de-labelling curves. One problem in interpreting BrdU data is explaining the de-labelling curves. Because shortly after label withdrawal, BrdU+ cells are expected to divide into BrdU+ daughter cells, one would expect a flat down-slope. As for many cell types, the fraction of BrdU+ cells decreases during de-labelling, previous mathematical models had to make debatable assumptions to be able to account for the data. We develop a mechanistic model tracking the number of divisions that each cell has undergone in the presence and absence of BrdU, and allow cells to accumulate and dilute their BrdU content. From the same mechanistic model, one can naturally derive expressions for the mean BrdU content (MBC) of all cells, or the MBC of the BrdU+ subset, which is related to the mean fluorescence intensity of BrdU that can be measured in experiments. The model is extended to include subpopulations with different rates of division and death (i.e. kinetic heterogeneity). We fit the extended model to previously published BrdU data from memory T lymphocytes in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected macaques, and find that the model describes the data with at least the same quality as previous models. Because the same model predicts a modest decline in the MBC of BrdU+ cells, which is consistent with experimental observations, BrdU dilution seems a natural explanation for the observed down-slopes in self-renewing populations.},

	Abstract = {Background
The linear noise approximation (LNA) is commonly used to predict how noise is regulated and exploited at the cellular level. These predictions are exact for reaction networks composed exclusively of first order reactions or for networks involving bimolecular reactions and large numbers of molecules. It is however well known that gene regulation involves bimolecular interactions with molecule numbers as small as a single copy of a particular gene. It is therefore questionable how reliable are the LNA predictions for these systems.

Results
We implement in the software package intrinsic Noise Analyzer (iNA), a system size expansion based method which calculates the mean concentrations and the variances of the fluctuations to an order of accuracy higher than the LNA. We then use iNA to explore the parametric dependence of the Fano factors and of the coefficients of variation of the mRNA and protein fluctuations in models of genetic networks involving nonlinear protein degradation, post-transcriptional, post-translational and negative feedback regulation. We find that the LNA can significantly underestimate the amplitude and period of noise-induced oscillations in genetic oscillators. We also identify cases where the LNA predicts that noise levels can be optimized by tuning a bimolecular rate constant whereas our method shows that no such regulation is possible. All our results are confirmed by stochastic simulations.

Conclusion
The software iNA allows the investigation of parameter regimes where the LNA fares well and where it does not. We have shown that the parametric dependence of the coefficients of variation and Fano factors for common gene regulatory networks is better described by including terms of higher order than LNA in the system size expansion. This analysis is considerably faster than stochastic simulations due to the extensive ensemble averaging needed to obtain statistically meaningful results. Hence iNA is well suited for performing computationally efficient and quantitative studies of intrinsic noise in gene regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {The chemical Fokker-Planck equation and the corresponding chemical Langevin equation are commonly used approximations of the chemical master equation. These equations are derived from an uncontrolled, second-order truncation of the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the chemical master equation and hence their accuracy remains to be clarified. We use the system-size expansion to show that chemical Fokker-Planck estimates of the mean concentrations and of the variance of the concentration fluctuations about the mean are accurate to order Ω−3/2 for reaction systems which do not obey detailed balance and at least accurate to order Ω−2 for systems obeying detailed balance, where Ω is the characteristic size of the system. Hence, the chemical Fokker-Planck equation turns out to be more accurate than the linear-noise approximation of the chemical master equation (the linear Fokker-Planck equation) which leads to mean concentration estimates accurate to order Ω−1/2 and variance estimates accurate to order Ω−3/2. This higher accuracy is particularly conspicuous for chemical systems realized in small volumes such as biochemical reactions inside cells. A formula is also obtained for the approximate size of the relative errors in the concentration and variance predictions of the chemical Fokker-Planck equation, where the relative error is defined as the difference between the predictions of the chemical Fokker-Planck equation and the master equation divided by the prediction of the master equation. For dimerization and enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the errors are typically less than few percent even when the steady-state is characterized by merely few tens of molecules.},

As a consequence, individual na{\"\i}ve T lymphocytes contributed differentially to short- and long-term protection, as revealed by participation of their progeny during primary versus recall infections.

	Abstract = {Peripheral T cell populations are maintained by production of naive T cells in the thymus, clonal expansion of activated cells, cellular self-renewal (or homeostatic proliferation), and density dependent cell life spans. A variety of experimental techniques have been employed to quantify the relative contributions of these processes. In modern studies lymphocytes are typically labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), deuterium, or the fluorescent dye carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), their division history has been studied by monitoring telomere shortening and the dilution of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or the dye CFSE, and clonal expansion has been documented by recording changes in the population densities of antigen specific cells. Proper interpretation of such data in terms of the underlying rates of T cell production, division, and death has proven to be notoriously difficult and involves mathematical modeling. We review the various models that have been developed for each of these techniques, discuss which models seem most appropriate for what type of data, reveal open problems that require better models, and pinpoint how the assumptions underlying a mathematical model may influence the interpretation of data. Elaborating various successful cases where modeling has delivered new insights in T cell population dynamics, this review provides quantitative estimates of several processes involved in the maintenance of naive and memory, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell pools in mice and men.},

	Abstract = {Dynamical systems are a valuable tool for exploring the regulatory organization of living organisms on a molecular level. Here, profound knowledge about underlying reaction rate parameters is essential for biological predictions and hypotheses. Bayesian methods provide a sophisticated approach to infer these parameters including statistical dependencies and uncertainties. Moreover, they are able to determine an appropriate model structure by model selection. As the posterior distributions involved are generally analytically intractable, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used for inference. However, owing to posterior complexity, these methods are often ineciently sampling from the according parameter spaces. In this thesis we develop a Copula based Independence/random walk Metropolis-Hastings (CIMH) sampling scheme for ecient model inference of differential
equation based dynamical systems. The concept exploits a vine copula decomposition of the estimated posterior distribution in order to generate proposals that are distributed according to an approximation of the true posterior distribution, which yields high acceptance rates. The basic CIMH algorithm is furthermore extended to an Adaptive MCMC scheme (ACIMH) to speed up convergence in complex systems. We thoroughly compare CIMH and ACIMH to existing methods on various examples. Furthermore, in applications from the  eld of systems biology, we examine the mechanism of nuclear phosphorylated STAT3 dimer import in the JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathway. Here, ACIMH infers a pathway model based on mouse hepatocyte data. In addition, using CIMH, we analyze a biokinetic compartment model for zirconium processing in the human body that can readily be used in radiation protection. Transfer rates (including credible intervals) for an average individual are provided and form the basis for analyses considering retrospective dosimetry and bone retention of zirconium.

	Abstract = {Hematopoiesis is an ideal model system for stem cell biology with advanced experimental access. A systems view on the interactions of core transcription factors is important for understanding differentiation mechanisms and dynamics. In this manuscript, we construct a Boolean network to model myeloid differentiation, specifically from common myeloid progenitors to megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. By interpreting the hematopoietic literature and translating experimental evidence into Boolean rules, we implement binary dynamics on the resulting 11-factor regulatory network. Our network contains interesting functional modules and a concatenation of mutual antagonistic pairs. The state space of our model is a hierarchical, acyclic graph, typifying the principles of myeloid differentiation. We observe excellent agreement between the steady states of our model and microarray expression profiles of two different studies. Moreover, perturbations of the network topology correctly reproduce reported knockout phenotypes in silico. We predict previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions and alterations of the differentiation process, and line out reprogramming strategies.},

This often leads to serious trouble in practice -- even in the absence of round-off errors -- as the present article illustrates via numerous examples. Fortunately, with the now widespread availability of computers, avoiding all the trouble is simple and easy: without the problematic division by nearly zero, the actual values taken by goodness-of-fit statistics are not humanly interpretable, but black-box computer programs can rapidly calculate their precise significance.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the origins and diversity of life has been arguably the most sought after desire since the birth of mankind. For higher organisms, a single cell origin diversifying into multiple cell types along the differentiation trajectories is very intriguing. Although numerous works on stem cells and cell differentiation research have elucidated indispensible details of crucial cellular markers necessary for diversification, whether randomness or determinism governs cell fate decision is still debatable (Losick and Desplan, 2008; Jullien et al., 2011).

In Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory, natural selection refers to a gradual adaptation of species to its environment over long periods of time through a non-random process (Darwin, 1859; Beddall, 1968; Wright, 1968). That is, Darwin believed that some sort of memory states exist in living system that is capable to invoke survivability under drastic environmental changes over time. This idea is in contrast to his predecessors, who believed in ``chance'' for species diversification for survival. So, at cellular level, is probability or non-random process crucial for a cell's survival to environmental changes?

Recent works in Bacillus subtilis have shown that biological noise or randomness in transcriptional machinery is crucial for controlling cell fate decision. Depending on the amount of nutrient available, B. subtilis survives in three modes: vegetative, competent, and sporulative. A key molecule for switching states between vegetative and competence is the transcription factor ComK. In nutrient deficient conditions, B. subtilis survives in competent state by DNA uptake from the surrounding, facilitated by ComK which support the construction of DNA-binding and uptake apparatus (van Sinderen et al., 1995). In other words, lower concentration of ComK refers to vegetative state while higher concentration leads to competence, with an unknown threshold level switching between the states. However, a population of B. subtilis in nutrient deficient conditions does not deterministically show all cells becoming competent. Rather, a mixture of vegetative, competent, and sporulated cells exists (Figure ​(Figure1A,1A, left).

	Abstract = {The segmentation of the vertebrate body is laid down during early embryogenesis. The formation of signaling gradients, the periodic expression of genes of the Notch-, Fgf- and Wnt-pathways and their interplay in the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm (PSM) precedes the rhythmic budding of nascent somites at its anterior end, which later develops into epithelialized structures, the somites. Although many in silico models describing partial aspects of somitogenesis already exist, simulations of a complete causal chain from gene expression in the growth zone via the interaction of multiple cells to segmentation are rare. Here, we present an enhanced gene regulatory network (GRN) for mice in a simulation program that models the growing PSM by many virtual cells and integrates WNT3A and FGF8 gradient formation, periodic gene expression and Delta/Notch signaling. Assuming Hes7 as core of the somitogenesis clock and LFNG as modulator, we postulate a negative feedback of HES7 on Dll1 leading to an oscillating Dll1 expression as seen in vivo. Furthermore, we are able to simulate the experimentally observed wave of activated NOTCH (NICD) as a result of the interactions in the GRN. We esteem our model as robust for a wide range of parameter values with the Hes7 mRNA and protein decays exerting a strong influence on the core oscillator. Moreover, our model predicts interference between Hes1 and HES7 oscillators when their intrinsic frequencies differ. In conclusion, we have built a comprehensive model of somitogenesis with HES7 as core oscillator that is able to reproduce many experimentally observed data in mice.},

	Abstract = {The accepted stochastic descriptions of biochemical dynamics under well-mixed conditions are given by the Chemical Master Equation and the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, which are equivalent. The latter is a Monte-Carlo method, which, despite enjoying broad availability in a large number of existing software packages, is computationally expensive due to the huge amounts of ensemble averaging required for obtaining accurate statistical information. The former is a set of coupled differential-difference equations for the probability of the system being in any one of the possible mesoscopic states; these equations are typically computationally intractable because of the inherently large state space. Here we introduce the software package intrinsic Noise Analyzer (iNA), which allows for systematic analysis of stochastic biochemical kinetics by means of van Kampen's system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation. iNA is platform independent and supports the popular SBML format natively. The present implementation is the first to adopt a complementary approach that combines state-of-the-art analysis tools using the computer algebra system Ginac with traditional methods of stochastic simulation. iNA integrates two approximation methods based on the system size expansion, the Linear Noise Approximation and effective mesoscopic rate equations, which to-date have not been available to non-expert users, into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. In particular, the present methods allow for quick approximate analysis of time-dependent mean concentrations, variances, covariances and correlations coefficients, which typically outperforms stochastic simulations. These analytical tools are complemented by automated multi-core stochastic simulations with direct statistical evaluation and visualization. We showcase iNA's performance by using it to explore the stochastic properties of cooperative and non-cooperative enzyme kinetics and a gene network associated with circadian rhythms. The software iNA is freely available as executable binaries for Linux, MacOSX and Microsoft Windows, as well as the full source code under an open source license.},

	Abstract = {Background
Parameter estimation from experimental data is critical for mathematical modeling of protein regulatory networks. For realistic networks with dozens of species and reactions, parameter estimation is an especially challenging task. In this study, we present an approach for parameter estimation that is effective in fitting a model of the budding yeast cell cycle (comprising 26 nonlinear ordinary differential equations containing 126 rate constants) to the experimentally observed phenotypes (viable or inviable) of 119 genetic strains carrying mutations of cell cycle genes.

Results
Starting from an initial guess of the parameter values, which correctly captures the phenotypes of only 72 genetic strains, our parameter estimation algorithm quickly improves the success rate of the model to 105--111 of the 119 strains. This success rate is comparable to the best values achieved by a skilled modeler manually choosing parameters over many weeks. The algorithm combines two search and optimization strategies. First, we use Latin hypercube sampling to explore a region surrounding the initial guess. From these samples, we choose ∼20 different sets of parameter values that correctly capture wild type viability. These sets form the starting generation of differential evolution that selects new parameter values that perform better in terms of their success rate in capturing phenotypes. In addition to producing highly successful combinations of parameter values, we analyze the results to determine the parameters that are most critical for matching experimental outcomes and the most competitive strains whose correct outcome with a given parameter vector forces numerous other strains to have incorrect outcomes. These ``most critical parameters'' and ``most competitive strains'' provide biological insights into the model. Conversely, the ``least critical parameters'' and ``least competitive strains'' suggest ways to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization.

Conclusions
Our approach proves to be a useful tool to help systems biologists fit complex dynamical models to large experimental datasets. In the process of fitting the model to the data, the tool identifies suggestive correlations among aspects of the model and the data.},

	Abstract = {Molecular discreteness is apparent in small-volume chemical systems, such as biological cells, leading to stochastic kinetics. Here we present a theoretical framework to understand the effects of discreteness on the steady state of a monostable chemical reaction network. We consider independent realizations of the same chemical system in compartments of different volumes. Rate equations ignore molecular discreteness and predict the same average steady-state concentrations in all compartments. However, our theory predicts that the average steady state of the system varies with volume: if a species is more abundant than another for large volumes, then the reverse occurs for volumes below a critical value, leading to a concentration inversion effect. The addition of extrinsic noise increases the size of the critical volume. We theoretically predict the critical volumes and verify, by exact stochastic simulations, that rate equations are qualitatively incorrect in sub-critical volumes.},

	Abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

	Abstract = {Chemical master equations provide a mathematical description of stochastic reaction kinetics in well-mixed conditions. They are a valid description over length scales that are larger than the reactive mean free path and thus describe kinetics in compartments of mesoscopic and macroscopic dimensions. The trajectories of the stochastic chemical processes described by the master equation can be ensemble-averaged to obtain the average number density of chemical species, i.e., the true concentration, at any spatial scale of interest. For macroscopic volumes, the true concentration is very well approximated by the solution of the corresponding deterministic and macroscopic rate equations, i.e., the macroscopic concentration. However, this equivalence breaks down for mesoscopic volumes. These deviations are particularly significant for open systems and cannot be calculated via the Fokker--Planck or linear-noise approximations of the master equation. We utilize the system-size expansion including terms of the order of Ω−1/2 to derive a set of differential equations whose solution approximates the true concentration as given by the master equation. These equations are valid in any open or closed chemical reaction network and at both the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. In the limit of large volumes, the effective mesoscopic rate equations become precisely equal to the conventional macroscopic rate equations. We compare the three formalisms of effective mesoscopic rate equations, conventional rate equations, and chemical master equations by applying them to several biochemical reaction systems (homodimeric and heterodimeric protein-protein interactions, series of sequential enzyme reactions, and positive feedback loops) in nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. In all cases, we find that the effective mesoscopic rate equations can predict very well the true concentration of a chemical species. This provides a useful method by which one can quickly determine the regions of parameter space in which there are maximum differences between the solutions of the master equation and the corresponding rate equations. We show that these differences depend sensitively on the Fano factors and on the inherent structure and topology of the chemical network. The theory of effective mesoscopic rate equations generalizes the conventional rate equations of physical chemistry to describe kinetics in systems of mesoscopic size such as biological cells.},

	Abstract = {The problem of evaluating the goodness of the predictive distributions of hierarchical Bayesian and empirical Bayes models is investigated. A Bayesian predictive information criterion is proposed as an estimator of the posterior mean of the expected loglikelihood of the predictive distribution when the specified family of probability distributions does not contain the true distribution. The proposed criterion is developed by correcting the asymptotic bias of the posterior mean of the loglikelihood as an estimator of its expected loglikelihood. In the evaluation of hierarchical Bayesian models with random effects, regardless of our parametric focus, the proposed criterion considers the bias correction of the posterior mean of the marginal loglikelihood because it requires a consistent parameter estimator. The use of the bootstrap in model evaluation is also discussed.},

Considering the maximization of the posterior mean of the expected log-likelihood of the predictive distributions (Ando (2007a)), we develop the Bayesian predictive information criterion (BPIC). According to the numerical examples, we show that the posterior mean of the log-likelihood has a positive bias comparing with the posterior mean of the expected log-likelihood, and that the bias estimate of BPIC is close to the true bias. One of the advantages of BPIC is that we can optimize the size of Occam's razor. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed method performs well.},

	Abstract = {Herein, we describe an experimental and computational approach to perform quantitative carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) cell-division tracking in cultures of primary colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells, a hematopoietic progenitor cell type, which is an important target for the treatment of blood disorders and for the manufacture of red blood cells. CFSE labeling of CFU-Es isolated from mouse fetal livers was performed to examine the effects of stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in culture. We used a dynamic model of proliferation based on the Smith-Martin representation of the cell cycle to extract proliferation rates and death rates from CFSE time-series. However, we found that to accurately represent the cell population dynamics in differentiation cultures of CFU-Es, it was necessary to develop a model with generation-specific rate parameters. The generation-specific rates of proliferation and death were extracted for six generations (G(0) -G(5) ) and they revealed that, although SCF alone or EPO alone supported similar total cell outputs in culture, stimulation with EPO resulted in significantly higher proliferation rates from G(2) to G(5) and higher death rates in G(2) , G(3) , and G(5) compared with SCF. In addition, proliferation rates tended to increase from G(1) to G(5) in cultures supplemented with EPO and EPO + SCF, while they remained lower and more constant across generations with SCF. The results are consistent with the notion that SCF promotes CFU-E self-renewal while EPO promotes CFU-E differentiation in culture.},

The method is based on the integration of a mixture model formulation that takes into account the saliency of the features and a Bayesian approach to mixture learning that can be used to estimate the number of mixture components. The proposed learning algorithm follows the variational framework and can simultaneously optimize over the number of components, the saliency of the features, and the parameters of the mixture model.

Here we study a dynamical model in which cells of radius R within a diffusive medium communicate with each other via diffusion of a signalling substance produced by the cells. The model consists of an initial boundary value problem for a parabolic PDE describing the exterior concentration u of the signalling substance, coupled with N ODEs for the masses ai of the substance within each cell. We show that for small R the model can be approximated by a hierarchy of models, namely first a system of N coupled delay ODEs, and in a second step by N coupled ODEs. We give some illustrations of the dynamics of the approximate model.},

We propose a new penalized likelihood method for model selection of finite multivariate Gaussian mixture models. The proposed method is shown to be statistically consistent in determining of the number of components. A modified EM algorithm is developed to simultaneously select the number of components and to estimate the mixing weights, i.e. the mixing probabilities, and unknown parameters of Gaussian distributions. Simulations and a real data analysis are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability distributions.Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so.We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a Levy-driven stochastic volatility model.

	Abstract = {The model selection literature has been generally poor at reflecting the deep foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and at making appropriate comparisons to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ``savvy'' prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

	Abstract = {Order selection is a fundamental and challenging problem in the application of finite mixture models. We develop a new penalized likelihood approach that we call MSCAD. MSCAD deviates from information-based methods, such as Akaike information criterion and the Bayes information criterion, by introducing two penalty functions that depend on the mixing proportions and the component parameters. It is consistent in estimating both the order of the mixture model and the mixing distribution. Simulations show that MSCAD performs much better than some existing methods. Two real-data examples are examined to illustrate its performance.},

	Abstract = {Stochasticity is an essential aspect of biochemical processes at the cellular level. We now know that living cells take advantage of stochasticity in some cases and counteract stochastic effects in others. Here we propose a method that allows us to calculate contributions of individual reactions to the total variability of a system's output. We demonstrate that reactions differ significantly in their relative impact on the total noise and we illustrate the importance of protein degradation on the overall variability for a range of molecular processes and signaling systems. With our flexible and generally applicable noise decomposition method, we are able to shed new, to our knowledge, light on the sources and propagation of noise in biochemical reaction networks; in particular, we are able to show how regulated protein degradation can be employed to reduce the noise in biochemical systems.},

	Abstract = {This work investigates the potentials of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to perform stimulus design for cancer treatment. A simple TNF signal transduction model with bistable behavior is used as a case study to design the optimal TNF stimulus. The goal of the stimulus design is to kill as many cancer cells as possible while using as little TNF as possible. The model is used as a single cell model as well as a cell population model. The first simulations suggest an optimal stimulus form after NMPC is applied on the mean single cell of a population. Further simulations where NMPC is applied on each single cell of a population indicate the limits both of the system and the stimulus design. To incorporate feedback and to improve the predictions of the NMPC controller parameter estimation is performed on four different cell populations. The simulation results show the inadequacy of using single cell models to fit cell population behavior.},

@inproceedings{KazeroonianHas2013,
	Abstract = {Background: Many biochemical processes exhibit intrinsic stochastic fluctuations. These intrinsic fluctuations can be modeled using the chemical master equation (CME). The estimation of the parameters of the CME is challenging, because the CME is a high- or infinite dimensional system.

Methods: We compare two approaches currently used to estimate parameters of CMEs from population snapshot data. The first approach relies on a truncation of CME, the finite state projection, and uses the data directly. The second method relies on moment equations -- dynamical systems computing the statistical moments of the CME solution -- and merely uses the statistical moments of the data. The second method is computationally more efficient, however, it cannot use all information contained in the data. In this manuscript, we assess the statistical power of the individual approaches and study moment equations of different order. Furthermore, we refine the likelihood function for the moment equation and introduce a novel validation method.

Results and Conclusion: We performed a comparative study employing the commonly used three-stage model of gene expression. Using maximum likelihood estimates and a rigorous uncertainty quantification based upon profile likelihoods, we show that the approach based on the finite state projection is statistically indeed more powerful. Nevertheless, even in case of partial observations, the first and second moments of the CME solution are highly informative and establish identifiability. These findings in combination with the novel tools for validation and uncertainty analysis improve the insight into the problem class.

	Abstract = {Background
Diffusion is a key component of many biological processes such as chemotaxis, developmental differentiation and tissue morphogenesis. Since recently, the spatial gradients caused by diffusion can be assessed in-vitro and in-vivo using microscopy based imaging techniques. The resulting time-series of two dimensional, high-resolutions images in combination with mechanistic models enable the quantitative analysis of the underlying mechanisms. However, such a model-based analysis is still challenging due to measurement noise and sparse observations, which result in uncertainties of the model parameters.

Methods
We introduce a likelihood function for image-based measurements with log-normal distributed noise. Based upon this likelihood function we formulate the maximum likelihood estimation problem, which is solved using PDE-constrained optimization methods. To assess the uncertainty and practical identifiability of the parameters we introduce profile likelihoods for diffusion processes.

Results and conclusion
As proof of concept, we model certain aspects of the guidance of dendritic cells towards lymphatic vessels, an example for haptotaxis. Using a realistic set of artificial measurement data, we estimate the five kinetic parameters of this model and compute profile likelihoods. Our novel approach for the estimation of model parameters from image data as well as the proposed identifiability analysis approach is widely applicable to diffusion processes. The profile likelihood based method provides more rigorous uncertainty bounds in contrast to local approximation methods.},

	Abstract = {The spindle assembly checkpoint is a conserved signalling pathway that protects genome integrity. Given its central importance, this checkpoint should withstand stochastic fluctuations and environmental perturbations, but the extent of and mechanisms underlying its robustness remain unknown. We probed spindle assembly checkpoint signalling by modulating checkpoint protein abundance and nutrient conditions in fission yeast. For core checkpoint proteins, a mere 20% reduction can suffice to impair signalling, revealing a surprising fragility. Quantification of protein abundance in single cells showed little variability (noise) of critical proteins, explaining why the checkpoint normally functions reliably. Checkpoint-mediated stoichiometric inhibition of the anaphase activator Cdc20 (Slp1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) can account for the tolerance towards small fluctuations in protein abundance and explains our observation that some perturbations lead to non-genetic variation in the checkpoint response. Our work highlights low gene expression noise as an important determinant of reliable checkpoint signalling.},

	Abstract = {Background
Mathematical models are nowadays widely used to describe biochemical reaction networks. One of the main reasons for this is that models facilitate the integration of a multitude of different data and data types using parameter estimation. Thereby, models allow for a holistic understanding of biological processes. However, due to measurement noise and the limited amount of data, uncertainties in the model parameters should be considered when conclusions are drawn from estimated model attributes, such as reaction fluxes or transient dynamics of biological species.

Methods and results
We developed the visual analytics system iVUN that supports uncertainty-aware analysis of static and dynamic attributes of biochemical reaction networks modeled by ordinary differential equations. The multivariate graph of the network is visualized as a node-link diagram, and statistics of the attributes are mapped to the color of nodes and links of the graph. In addition, the graph view is linked with several views, such as line plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, to support locating uncertainties and the analysis of their time dependencies. As demonstration, we use iVUN to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of a model for Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling.

Conclusion
Our case study showed that iVUN can be used to perform an in-depth study of biochemical reaction networks, including attribute uncertainties, correlations between these attributes and their uncertainties as well as the attribute dynamics. In particular, the linking of different visualization options turned out to be highly beneficial for the complex analysis tasks that come with the biological systems as presented here.},

	Abstract = {Background
The establishment of the mid-hindbrain region in vertebrates is mediated by the isthmic organizer, an embryonic secondary organizer characterized by a well-defined pattern of locally restricted gene expression domains with sharply delimited boundaries. While the function of the isthmic organizer at the mid-hindbrain boundary has been subject to extensive experimental studies, it remains unclear how this well-defined spatial gene expression pattern, which is essential for proper isthmic organizer function, is established during vertebrate development. Because the secreted Wnt1 protein plays a prominent role in isthmic organizer function, we focused in particular on the refinement of Wnt1 gene expression in this context.

Results
We analyzed the dynamics of the corresponding murine gene regulatory network and the related, diffusive signaling proteins using a macroscopic model for the biological two-scale signaling process. Despite the discontinuity arising from the sharp gene expression domain boundaries, we proved the existence of unique, positive solutions for the partial differential equation system. This enabled the numerically and analytically analysis of the formation and stability of the expression pattern. Notably, the calculated expression domain of Wnt1 has no sharp boundary in contrast to experimental evidence. We subsequently propose a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for Wnt1 miRNAs which yields the observed sharp expression domain boundaries. We established a list of candidate miRNAs and confirmed their expression pattern by radioactive in situ hybridization. The miRNA miR-709 was identified as a potential regulator of Wnt1 mRNA, which was validated by luciferase sensor assays.

Conclusion
In summary, our theoretical analysis of the gene expression pattern induction at the mid-hindbrain boundary revealed the need to extend the model by an additional Wnt1 regulation. The developed macroscopic model of a two-scale process facilitate the stringent analysis of other morphogen-based patterning processes.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge about the molecular structure of protein kinase A (PKA) isoforms is substantial. In contrast, the dynamics of PKA isoform activity in living primary cells has not been investigated in detail. Using a high content screening microscopy approach, we identified the RIIβ subunit of PKA-II to be predominantly expressed in a subgroup of sensory neurons. The RIIβ-positive subgroup included most neurons expressing nociceptive markers (TRPV1, NaV1.8, CGRP, IB4) and responded to pain-eliciting capsaicin with calcium influx. Isoform-specific PKA reporters showed in sensory-neuron-derived F11 cells that the inflammatory mediator PGE2 specifically activated PKA-II but not PKA-I. Accordingly, pain-sensitizing inflammatory mediators and activators of PKA increased the phosphorylation of RII subunits (pRII) in subgroups of primary sensory neurons. Detailed analyses revealed basal pRII to be regulated by the phosphatase PP2A. Increase of pRII was followed by phosphorylation of CREB in a PKA-dependent manner. Thus, we propose RII phosphorylation to represent an isoform-specific readout for endogenous PKA-II activity in vivo, suggest RIIβ as a novel nociceptive subgroup marker, and extend the current model of PKA-II activation by introducing a PP2A-dependent basal state.},

	Abstract = {Abstract 
Growth factors such as NGF and GDNF are known to induce pain sensitization. However, a plethora of other growth factors is released during inflammation and tissue regeneration, and many of them are essential for wound healing. Which wound healing factors also alter the sensitivity of nociceptive neurons is not well known.

We studied the wound healing factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), for its role in pain sensitization. RT-PCR showed that the receptor of bFGF, FGFR1, is expressed in lumbal rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). We demonstrated presence of FGFR1 protein in DRG neurons by a recently introduced quantitative automated immunfluorescent microscopic technique. FGFR1 was expressed in all lumbal DRG neurons as quantified by mixture modeling. Corroborating the mRNA and protein expression data, bFGF induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in nociceptive neurons, which could be blocked by inhibition of FGF receptors. Furthermore, bFGF activated Erk1/2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Using single cell electrophysiological recordings, we found that bFGF treatment of DRG neurons increased the current-density of NaV1.8 channels. Erk1/2 inhibitors abrogated this increase. Importantly, intradermal injection of bFGF in rats induced Erk1/2-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia.

Perspective
Analysing intracellular signaling dynamics in nociceptive neurons has proven to be a powerful approach to identify novel modulators of pain. In addition to describing a new sensitizing factor, our findings indicate the potential to investigate wound healing factors for their role in nociception.},

	Abstract = {Mixed effects models have received a great deal of attention in the statistical literature for the past forty years because of the flexibility they offer in handling the unbalanced clustered data that arise in many areas of investigation. In this dissertation we consider both linear and nonlinear mixed effects models under maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimation. We derive the asymptotic distribution of both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimators in a general linear mixed effects models, under mild regularity conditions. We study different approximations to the loglikelihood function of nonlinear mixed effects models, comparing them with respect to their accuracy and computational efficiency. We describe five different parametrizations for variance-covariance matrices that ensure positive definiteness, while leaving the estimation problem unconstrained, comparing them with respect to their computational efficiency and statistical interpretability. We consider the model building issue for mixed effects models, describing techniques for choosing random effects to be incorporated in the model, using structured random effects variance-covariance matrices, and using covariates to explain cluster-to-cluster parameter variability. Finally we describe the S software we have developed for analyzing linear and nonlinear mixed effects models and which we have contributed to the StatLib collection.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear random effects models with finite mixture structures are used to identify polymorphism in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic phenotypes. An EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation approach is developed and uses sampling-based methods to implement the expectation step, that results in an analytically tractable maximization step. A benefit of the approach is that no model linearization is performed and the estimation precision can be arbitrarily controlled by the sampling process. A detailed simulation study illustrates the feasibility of the estimation approach and evaluates its performance. Applications of the proposed nonlinear random effects mixture model approach to other population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic problems will be of interest for future investigation.},

	Abstract = {Pseudomonas syringae is a gram-negative bacterium which lives on leaf surfaces. Its growth has been described using epifluorescence microscopy and image analysis; it was found to be growing in aggregates of a wide range of sizes. We develop a stochastic model to describe aggregate distribution and determine the mechanisms generating experimental observations. We found that a logistic birth--death model with migration (time-homogeneous Markov process) provides the best description of the observed data. We discuss how to analyze the joint distribution of the numbers of aggregates of different sizes at a given time and explore how to account for new aggregates being created, that is, the joint distribution of the family size statistics conditional on the total number of aggregates. We compute the first two moments. Through simulations we examine how the model's parameters affect the aggregate size distribution and successfully explain the quantitative experimental data available. Aggregation formation is thought to be the first step towards pathogenic behavior of this bacterium; understanding aggregate size distribution would prove useful to understand the switch from epiphytic to pathogenic behavior.},

	Abstract = {Background
When mathematical modelling is applied to many different application areas, a common task is the estimation of states and parameters based on measurements. With this kind of inference making, uncertainties in the time when the measurements have been taken are often neglected, but especially in applications taken from the life sciences, this kind of errors can considerably influence the estimation results. As an example in the context of personalized medicine, the model-based assessment of the effectiveness of drugs is becoming to play an important role. Systems biology may help here by providing good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models. Inference on these systems based on data gained from clinical studies with several patient groups becomes a major challenge. Particle filters are a promising approach to tackle these difficulties but are by itself not ready to handle uncertainties in measurement times.

Results
In this article, we describe a variant of the standard particle filter (PF) algorithm which allows state and parameter estimation with the inclusion of measurement time uncertainties (MTU). The modified particle filter, which we call MTU-PF, also allows the application of an adaptive stepsize choice in the time-continuous case to avoid degeneracy problems. The modification is based on the model assumption of uncertain measurement times. While the assumption of randomness in the measurements themselves is common, the corresponding measurement times are generally taken as deterministic and exactly known. Especially in cases where the data are gained from measurements on blood or tissue samples, a relatively high uncertainty in the true measurement time seems to be a natural assumption. Our method is appropriate in cases where relatively few data are used from a relatively large number of groups or individuals, which introduce mixed effects in the model. This is a typical setting of clinical studies. We demonstrate the method on a small artificial example and apply it to a mixed effects model of plasma-leucine kinetics with data from a clinical study which included 34 patients.

Conclusions
MTU-PF with the standard PF and with an alternative Maximum Likelihood estimation method on the small artificial example clearly show that the MTU-PF obtains better estimations. Considering the application to the data from the clinical study, the MTU-PF shows a similar performance with respect to the quality of estimated parameters compared with the standard particle filter, but besides that, the MTU algorithm shows to be less prone to degeneration than the standard particle filter.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Biochemical reaction networks in the form of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide a powerful modeling tool for understanding the dynamics of biochemical processes. During the early phase of modeling, scientists have to deal with a large pool of competing nonlinear models. At this point, discrimination experiments can be designed and conducted to obtain optimal data for selecting the most plausible model. Since biological ODE models have widely distributed parameters due to, e.g. biologic variability or experimental variations, model responses become distributed. Therefore, a robust optimal experimental design (OED) for model discrimination can be used to discriminate models based on their response probability distribution functions (PDFs).

Results: In this work, we present an optimal control-based methodology for designing optimal stimulus experiments aimed at robust model discrimination. For estimating the time-varying model response PDF, which results from the nonlinear propagation of the parameter PDF under the ODE dynamics, we suggest using the sigma-point approach. Using the model overlap (expected likelihood) as a robust discrimination criterion to measure dissimilarities between expected model response PDFs, we benchmark the proposed nonlinear design approach against linearization with respect to prediction accuracy and design quality for two nonlinear biological reaction networks. As shown, the sigma-point outperforms the linearization approach in the case of widely distributed parameter sets and/or existing multiple steady states. Since the sigma-point approach scales linearly with the number of model parameter, it can be applied to large systems for robust experimental planning.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Computational modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks is a central task of systems biology. For networks of small/medium scale, the dominant paradigm is represented by systems of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ODEs afford great mechanistic detail and flexibility, but calibrating these models to data is often an extremely difficult statistical problem.

Results: Here we develop a general statistical inference framework for stochastic transcription-translation networks. We use a coarsegrained approach which represents the system as a network of stochastic (binary) promoter and (continuous) protein variables. We derive an exact inference algorithm and an efficient variational approximation which allows scalable inference and learning of the model parameters. We demonstrate the power of the approach on two biological case studies, showing that the method allows a high degree of flexibility and is capable of testable novel biological predictions.},

	Abstract = {Graphs are used to model relations between sets of objects. Objects are represented by vertices and relations by edges of the graph. Besides vertex-vertex relations, in some application domains also relations between edges exist. Our new visualization approach supports the investigation of both relation types in one diagram. Edge-edge relations are visualized as curves that are directly integrated into the node-link diagram that represents the object-relation structure. In contrast, vertex-vertex relations are illustrated distinguishably from edge-edge relations using straight links as representations. While the shape of links is used to differentiate between the relation types, the weights of the edge-edge relations are mapped to the width and color of the curves. To facilitate an extensive analysis of interrelations, our approach incorporates several interaction techniques that can be used for filtering and highlighting. The usability of our visualization is demonstrated with two case studies in the application domains of bioinformatics and financial services. },

	Abstract = {Our understanding of most biological systems is in its infancy. Learning their structure and intricacies is fraught with challenges, and often side-stepped in favour of studying the function of different gene products in isolation from their physiological context. Constructing and inferring global mathematical models from experimental data is, however, central to systems biology. Different experimental setups provide different insights into such systems. Here we show how we can combine concepts from Bayesian inference and information theory in order to identify experiments that maximize the information content of the resulting data. This approach allows us to incorporate preliminary information; it is global and not constrained to some local neighbourhood in parameter space and it readily yields information on parameter robustness and confidence. Here we develop the theoretical framework and apply it to a range of exemplary problems that highlight how we can improve experimental investigations into the structure and dynamics of biological systems and their behavior.},

	Abstract = {Noise in gene expression is generated at multiple levels, such as transcription and translation, chromatin remodeling and pathway-specific regulation. Studies of individual promoters have suggested different dominating noise sources, raising the question of whether a general trend exists across a large number of genes and conditions. We examined the variation in the expression levels of 43 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, in cells grown under 11 experimental conditions. For all classes of genes and under all conditions, the expression variance was approximately proportional to the mean; the same scaling was observed at steady state and during the transient responses to the perturbations. Theoretical analysis suggests that this scaling behavior reflects variability in mRNA copy number, resulting from random 'birth and death' of mRNA molecules or from promoter fluctuations. Deviation of coexpressed genes from this general trend, including high noise in stress-related genes and low noise in proteasomal genes, may indicate fluctuations in pathway-specific regulators or a differential activation pattern of the underlying gene promoters.},

	Abstract = {Although much has been done to elucidate the biochemistry of signal transduction and gene regulatory pathways, it remains difficult to understand or predict quantitative responses. We integrate single-cell experiments with stochastic analyses, to identify predictive models of transcriptional dynamics for the osmotic stress response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generate models with varying complexity and use parameter estimation and cross-validation analyses to select the most predictive model. This model yields insight into several dynamical features, including multistep regulation and switchlike activation for several osmosensitive genes. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the transcriptional dynamics of cells in response to different environmental and genetic perturbations. Because our approach is general, it should facilitate a predictive understanding for signal-activated transcription of other genes in other pathways or organisms.},

	Abstract = {Life processes in single cells and at the molecular level are inherently stochastic. Quantifying the noise is, however, far from trivial, as a major contribution comes from intrinsic fluctuations, arising from the randomness in the times between discrete jumps. It is shown in this paper how a noise-filtering setup with an operator theoretic interpretation can be relevant for analyzing the intrinsic stochasticity in jump processes described by master equations. Such interpretation naturally exists in linear noise approximations, but it also provides an exact description of the jump process when the transition rates are linear. As an important example, it is shown in this paper how, by addressing the proximity of the underlying dynamics in an appropriate topology, a sequence of coupled birth-death processes, which can be relevant in gene expression, tends to a pure delay; this implies important limitations in noise suppression capabilities. Despite the exactness, in a linear regime, of the analysis of noise in conjunction with the network dynamics, we emphasize in this paper the importance of also analyzing dynamic behavior when transition rates are highly nonlinear; otherwise, steady-state solutions can be misinterpreted. The examples are taken from systems with macroscopic models leading to bistability. It is discussed that bistability in the deterministic mass action kinetics and bimodality in the steady-state solution of the master equation neither always imply one another nor do they necessarily lead to efficient switching behaviours: the underlying dynamics need to be taken into account. Finally, we explore some of these issues in relation to a model of the lac operation.},

	Abstract = {This dissertation discusses the Finite State Projection (FSP) method for the direct computational analysis of probability distributions arising from discrete state Markov Processes. While the methods contained herein apply to a wide range of scientific inquiries, this study focuses on the treatment of chemically reacting biological systems. The probability distributions of such systems evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME) or forward Kolmogorov equation. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct configurations, then the FSP method provides an exact analytical expression for its solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of variations is possible, the state space is truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the FSP approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space to meet any pre-specified error tolerance in the probability distribution. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP solution exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP approach is enhanced by taking advantage of well-known tools from modern control and dynamical systems theory such as minimal realizations, balanced truncation, linear perturbation theory, and coarse gridding approaches. Each such reduction has successfully improved the efficiency and applicability of the FSP, and more are envisioned to be possible.

The power of the FSP is illustrated on a few important genetic regulatory networks including a toy model of the heat shock mechanism in E. coli and a detailed analysis of a genetic toggle switch. The FSP method is also applied to a detailed model of the Pap pili epigenetic switch in E. coli. The Pap model predicts the switching behavior of the Pap system under varying levels of various regulatory molecules and under the influence of various gene insertions and mutations. When possible, predictions have been validated against experimental observations. In all cases, the current model matches the observed qualitative behavior of the Pap switch and provides an excellent starting point for future Pap modeling endeavors.},

	Abstract = {t has been proposed' that gene-regulatory circuits with virtually any desired property can be constructed from networks of simple regulatory elements. These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage lambda switch and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the derivation of approximations for stochastic chemical kinetics governed by the discrete master equation. Here, the concepts of (1) partitioning on the basis of fast and slow reactions as opposed to fast and slow species and (2) conditional probability densities are used to derive approximate, partitioned master equations, which are Markovian in nature, from the original master equation. Under different conditions dictated by relaxation time arguments, such approximations give rise to both the equilibrium and hybrid (deterministic or Langevin equations coupled with discrete stochastic simulation) approximations previously reported. In addition, the derivation points out several weaknesses in previous justifications of both the hybrid and equilibrium systems and demonstrates the connection between the original and approximate master equations. Two simple examples illustrate situations in which these two approximate methods are applicable and demonstrate the two methods' efficiencies.},

	Abstract = {Exact methods are available for the simulation of isothermal, well-mixed stochastic chemical kinetics. As increasingly complex physical systems are modeled, however, these methods become difficult to solve because the computational burden scales with the number of reaction events. This paper addresses one aspect of this problem: the case in which reacting species fluctuate by different orders of magnitude. By partitioning the system into subsets of ``fast'' and ``slow'' reactions, it is possible to bound the computational load by approximating ``fast'' reactions either deterministically or as Langevin equations. This paper provides a theoretical background for such approximations and outlines strategies for computing these approximations. Two motivating examples drawn from the fields of particle technology and biotechnology illustrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of these approximations.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new statistic for testing the equality of two multivariate mean vectors. A scaled chi-squared distribution is proposed as an approximating null distribution. Because the test statistic is based on componentwise statistics, it has the advantage over Hotelling's T2 test of being applicable to the case where the dimension of an observation exceeds the number of observations. An appealing feature of the new test is its ability to handle missing data by relying on only componentwise sample moments. Monte Carlo studies indicate good power compared to Hotelling's T2 and a recently proposed test by Srivastava (2004, Technical Report, University of Toronto). The test is applied to drug discovery data.},

	Abstract = {Cell surface receptors convert extracellular cues into receptor activation, thereby triggering intracellular signaling networks and controlling cellular decisions. A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools. These receptor properties enable the system to cope with basal and acute demand in the hematopoietic system.},

	Abstract = {Cellular signal transduction is governed by multiple feedback mechanisms to elicit robust cellular decisions. The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold in vivo. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.},

	Abstract = {Gene regulatory networks are dynamic and stochastic in nature, and exhibit exquisite feedback and feedforward control loops that regulate their biological function at different levels. Modelling of such networks poses new challenges due, in part, to the small number of molecules involved and the stochastic nature of their interactions. In this article, we motivate the stochastic modelling of genetic networks and demonstrate the approach using several examples. We discuss the mathematics of molecular noise models including the chemical master equation, the chemical Langevin equation, and the reaction rate equation.

Our approach is based on the construction of a stochastic hybrid model in which certain discrete random variables of the original Markov chain are approximated by continuous deterministic variables. We compute the solution of the stochastic hybrid model using a numerical algorithm that discretizes time and in each step performs a mutual update of the transient probability distribution of the discrete stochastic variables and the values of the continuous deterministic variables. We implemented the algorithm and we demonstrate its usefulness and efficiency on several case studies from systems biology.},

	Abstract = {Higher resolution biological data is now becoming available in ever greater quantities, allowing the complex behaviour of fundamental biological processes to be studied in much more detail. The area of Systems Biology is in desperate need of methods for inferring the most likely topology of the underlying genetic networks from this oftentimes noisy and poorly sampled data, to support the construction and testing of new model hypotheses. Towards that end, Bayesian methodology provides an ideal framework for tackling such challenges, and in particular offers a means of objectively comparing competing plausible models through the estimation of Bayes factors.

There are, however, formidable obstacles which must be overcome to allow model inference using Bayes factors to be of practical use. Many important biological processes may be most accurately represented using nonlinear models based on systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), however parameter inference over these models often produces correspondingly nonlinear posterior distributions, which are very challenging to sample from, often resulting in biased marginal likelihood estimates with large variances. Such problems are commonly encountered when modelling circardian rhythms, which exhibit highly nonlinear oscillatory dynamics and play a central role in the overall functioning of most organisms. In this thesis I investigate tools for calculating Bayes factors to distinguish between ODE-based Goodwin oscillator models of varying complexity, which form the basic building blocks for describing this ubiquitous circadian behaviour.

The main result in Chapter 3 of this thesis demonstrates how Population Markov Chain Monte Carlo may be employed in conjunction with thermodynamic integration methods to estimate Bayes factors which may accurately distinguish between two nonlinear oscillator models of varying complexity, given noisy experimental data generated from each of the models. In addition, it is shown how alternative methods may fail drastically in this setting, in particular harmonic mean based estimates. Suggestions are given regarding the optimal temperature schedule which should be employed for Population MCMC, and several ideas for future research extending this work are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Although stochastic population models have proved to be a powerful tool in the study of process generating mechanisms across a wide range of disciplines, all too often the associated mathematical development involves nonlinear mathematics, which immediately raises difficult and challenging analytic problems that need to be solved if useful progress is to be made. One approximation that is often employed to estimate the moments of a stochastic process is moment closure. This approximation essentially truncates the moment equations of the stochastic process. A general expression for the marginal- and joint-moment equations for a large class of stochastic population models is presented. The generalisation of the moment equations allows this approximation to be applied easily to a wide range of models.

@article{ParksRoe2006,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:
In immunofluorescence measurements and most other flow cytometry applications, fluorescence signals of interest can range down to essentially zero. After fluorescence compensation, some cell populations will have low means and include events with negative data values. Logarithmic presentation has been very useful in providing informative displays of wide-ranging flow cytometry data, but it fails to adequately display cell populations with low means and high variances and, in particular, offers no way to include negative data values. This has led to a great deal of difficulty in interpreting and understanding flow cytometry data, has often resulted in incorrect delineation of cell populations, and has led many people to question the correctness of compensation computations that were, in fact, correct.
RESULTS:
We identified a set of criteria for creating data visualization methods that accommodate the scaling difficulties presented by flow cytometry data. On the basis of these, we developed a new data visualization method that provides important advantages over linear or logarithmic scaling for display of flow cytometry data, a scaling we refer to as "Logicle" scaling. Logicle functions represent a particular generalization of the hyperbolic sine function with one more adjustable parameter than linear or logarithmic functions. Finally, we developed methods for objectively and automatically selecting an appropriate value for this parameter.
CONCLUSIONS:
The Logicle display method provides more complete, appropriate, and readily interpretable representations of data that includes populations with low-to-zero means, including distributions resulting from fluorescence compensation procedures, than can be produced using either logarithmic or linear displays. The method includes a specific algorithm for evaluating actual data distributions and deriving parameters of the Logicle scaling function appropriate for optimal display of that data. It is critical to note that Logicle visualization does not change the data values or the descriptive statistics computed from them.},

Predicting a system's behavior based on a mathematical model is a primary task in Systems Biology. If the model parameters are estimated from experimental data, the parameter uncertainty has to be translated into confidence intervals for model predictions. For dynamic models of biochemical networks, the nonlinearity in combination with the large number of parameters hampers the calculation of prediction confidence intervals and renders classical approaches as hardly feasible.

Results
In this article reliable confidence intervals are calculated based on the prediction profile likelihood. Such prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states can be utilized for a data-based observability analysis. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters yielding to some insufficiently specified modelpredictions that can be interpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is introduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be interpreted.

Conclusions
The presented methodology allows the propagation of uncertainty from experimental to model pre-dictions. Although presented in the context of ordinary differential equations, the concept is general and also applicable to other types of models. Matlab code which can be used as a template to implement the method is provided at http://www.fdmold.uni-freiburg.de/~ckreutz/PPL .},

	Abstract = {A truly functional Bayesian method for detecting temporally differentially expressed genes between two experimental conditions is presented. The method distinguishes between two biologically different set ups, one in which the twosamples are interchangeable, and one in which the second sample is a modification of the first, i.e. the twosamples are non-interchangeable. This distinction leads to two different Bayesianmodels, which allow more flexibility in modeling gene expression profiles. The method allows one to identify differentially expressed genes, to rank them and to estimate their expression profiles. The proposed procedure successfully deals with various technical difficulties which arise in microarraytime-courseexperiments, such as small number of observations, non-uniform sampling intervals and presence of missing data or repeated measurements. The procedure allows one to account for various types of error, thus offering a good compromise between nonparametric and normality assumption based techniques. In addition, all evaluations are carried out using analytic expressions, hence the entire procedure requires very little computational effort. The performance of the procedure is studied using simulated and real data.},

	Abstract = {Many processes in cell biology encode and process information and enact responses by modulating the concentrations of biological molecules. Such modulations serve functions ranging from encoding and transmitting information about external stimuli to regulating internal metabolic states. To understand how such processes operate requires gaining insights into the basic mechanisms by which biochemical species interact and respond to internal and external perturbations. One approach is to model the biochemical species concentrations through the van Kampen Linear Noise Equations, which account for the change in biochemical concentrations from reactions and account for fluctuations in concentrations. For many systems, the Linear Noise Equations exhibit stiffness as a consequence of the chemical reactions occurring at significantly different rates. This presents challenges in the analysis of the kinetics and in performing efficient numerical simulations. To deal with this source of stiffness and to obtain reduced models more amenable to analysis, we present a systematic procedure for obtaining effective stochastic dynamics for the chemical species having relatively slow characteristic time scales while eliminating representations of the chemical species having relatively fast characteristic time scales. To demonstrate the applicability of this multiscale technique in the context of Linear Noise Equations, the reduction is applied to models of gene regulatory networks. Results are presented which compare numerical results for the full system to the reduced descriptions. The presented stochastic reduction procedure provides a potentially versatile tool for systematically obtaining reduced approximations of Linear Noise Equations.},

	Abstract = {Cell proliferation and differentiation is described by a multi-type branching process, a probability model that defines the inheritance of cell type. Cell type is defined by (i) a repression index related to the time required for S-phase entry and (ii) phenotype as determined by cell markers and division history. The inheritance of cell type is expressed as the expected number and type of progeny cells produced by a mother cell given her type. Expressions for the expected number and type of cells produced by a multi-cellular (bulk culture) system are derived from the general model by making the simplifying assumption that cell generation times are independent. The multi-type Smith--Martin model (MSM) makes the further assumption that cell generation times are lag-exponentially distributed with phenotype transitions occurring just before entry into S-phase. The inheritance-modified MSM (IMSM) model includes the influence of generation time memory so that mother and daughter generation times are correlated. The expansion of human cord blood CD34+ cells by haematopoietic growth factors was division tracked in bulk culture using carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). The MSM model was fitted to division tracking data to indentify cell cycle length, and the rates of CD34 antigen down-regulation and apoptosis. The IMSM model was estimated for mouse granulocyte--macrophage progenitors using live cell imaging data. Multi-type branching models describe cell differentiation dynamics at both single- and multi-cell scales, providing a new paradigm for systematic analysis of stem and progenitor cell development.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression plays a central role in the orchestration of cellular processes. The use of inducible promoters to change the expression level of a gene from its physiological level has significantly contributed to the understanding of the functioning of regulatory networks. However, from a quantitative point of view, their use is limited to short-term, population-scale studies to average out cell-to-cell variability and gene expression noise and limit the nonpredictable effects of internal feedback loops that may antagonize the inducer action. Here, we show that, by implementing an external feedback loop, one can tightly control the expression of a gene over many cell generations with quantitative accuracy. To reach this goal, we developed a platform for real-time, closed-loop control of gene expression in yeast that integrates microscopy for monitoring gene expression at the cell level, microfluidics to manipulate the cells' environment, and original software for automated imaging, quantification, and model predictive control. By using an endogenous osmostress responsive promoter and playing with the osmolarity of the cells environment, we show that long-term control can, indeed, be achieved for both time-constant and time-varying target profiles at the population and even the single-cell levels. Importantly, we provide evidence that real-time control can dynamically limit the effects of gene expression stochasticity. We anticipate that our method will be useful to quantitatively probe the dynamic properties of cellular processes and drive complex, synthetically engineered networks.},

	Abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {A novel class of interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, hereby referred to as the Parallel Hierarchical Sampler (PHS), is developed and its mixing properties are assessed. PHS algorithms are modular MCMC samplers designed to produce reliable estimates for multi-modal and heavy-tailed posterior distributions. As such, PHS aims at benefitting statisticians whom, working on a wide spectrum of applications, are more focused on defining and refining models than constructing sophisticated sampling strategies. Convergence of a vanilla PHS algorithm is proved for the case of Metropolis--Hastings within-chain updates. The accuracy of this PHS kernel is compared with that of optimized single-chain and multiple-chain MCMC algorithms for multi-modal mixtures of multivariate Gaussian densities and for `banana-shaped' heavy-tailed multivariate distributions. These examples show that PHS can yield a dramatic improvement in the precision of MCMC estimators over standard samplers. PHS is then applied to two realistically complex Bayesian model uncertainty scenarios. First, PHS is used to select a low number of meaningful predictors for a Gaussian linear regression model in the presence of high collinearity. Second, the posterior probability of survival trees approximated by PHS indicates that the number and size of liver metastases at the time of diagnosis are predictive of substantial differences in the survival distributions of colorectal cancer patients.},

	Abstract = {Characterizing the genome-wide dynamic regulation of gene expression is important and will be of much interest in the future. However, there is currently no established method for identifying differentially expressed genes in a time course study. Here we propose a significance method for analyzing time course microarray studies that can be applied to the typical types of comparisons and sampling schemes. This method is applied to two studies on humans. In one study, genes are identified that show differential expression over time in response to in vivo endotoxin administration. By using our method, 7,409 genes are called significant at a 1 percent false-discovery rate level, whereas several existing approaches fail to identify any genes. In another study, 417 genes are identified at a 10 percent false-discovery rate level that show expression changing with age in the kidney cortex. Here it is also shown that as many as 47 percent of the genes change with age in a manner more complex than simple exponential growth or decay. The methodology proposed here has been implemented in the freely distributed and open-source EDGE software package.},

@article{SinghRaz2012,
	Abstract = {Within individual cells, two molecular processes have been implicated as sources of noise in gene expression: (i) Poisson fluctuations in mRNA abundance arising from random birth and death of individual mRNA transcripts or (ii) promoter fluctuations arising from stochastic promoter transitions between different transcriptional states. Steady-state measurements of variance in protein levels are insufficient to discriminate between these two mechanisms, and mRNA single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) is challenging when cellular mRNA concentrations are high. Here, we present a perturbation method that discriminates mRNA birth/death fluctuations from promoter fluctuations by measuring transient changes in protein variance and that can operate in the regime of high molecular numbers. Conceptually, the method exploits the fact that transcriptional blockage results in more rapid increases in protein variability when mRNA birth/death fluctuations dominate over promoter fluctuations. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this perturbation approach in the HIV-1 model system. Our results support promoter fluctuations as the primary noise source in HIV-1 expression. This study illustrates a relatively simple method that complements mRNA smFISH hybridization and can be used with existing GFP-tagged libraries to include or exclude alternate sources of noise in gene expression.},

@article{HasenauerSch2012b,
	Abstract = {In most biological studies and processes, cell proliferation and population dynamics play an essential role. Due to this ubiquity, a multitude of mathematical models has been developed to describe these processes. While the simplest models only consider the size of the overall populations, others take division numbers and labeling of the cells into account. In this work, we present a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell populations undergoing symmetric cell division, which incorporates both the discrete division number and continuous label dynamics. Thus, it allows for the consideration of division number-dependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction with labeling experiments, e.g., performed with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and can be shown to be a generalization of most existing models used to describe these data. We prove that under mild assumptions the resulting system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) can be decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a set of decoupled PDEs, which drastically reduces the computational effort for simulating the model. Furthermore, the PDEs are solved analytically and the ODE system is truncated, which allows for the prediction of the label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional system of ODEs. In addition to modeling the label dynamics, we link the label-induced fluorescence to the measure fluorescence which includes autofluorescence. Furthermore, we provide an analytical approximation for the resulting numerically challenging convolution integral. This is illustrated by modeling and simulating a proliferating population with division number-dependent proliferation rate.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression is significantly stochastic making modeling of genetic networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins  decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we  calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative  comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

	Abstract = {Likelihood profiles for arbitrary functions of the model parameters are useful for constructing likelihood ratio confidence intervals, diagnosing linear approximation intervals, suggesting linearizing transforms, and many other purposes. This article investigates a simple integration method for producing accuratea pproximationst o likelihood profiles that avoid problems associated with producing exact profiles. A basic theorem guarantees that the approximation can achieve any desired precision. In many cases the method requires no more than adding a few lines of code to that required to produce the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter vector. Standard methods for computing likelihood profiles are based on solving a sequence of constrained maximum likelihood problems. Each problem generates a point on the profile. An earlier article proposed an integration method that generates the entire profile directly by solving a differential equation. That method, however, requires the Hessian of the log-likelihood which can be difficult to produce. The method considered here requires only the gradient. It may be particularly useful in conjunction with the EM algorithm which typically does not produce any type of confidence interval.},

	Abstract = {In the stochastic formulation of chemical reactions, the dynamics of the first M-order moments of the species populations generally do not form a closed system of differential equations, in the sense that the time-derivatives of first M-order moments generally depend on moments of order higher than M. However, for analysis purposes, these dynamics are often made to be closed by approximating the needed derivatives of the first M-order moments by nonlinear functions of the same moments. These functions are called the moment closure functions. Recent results have introduced the technique of derivative-matching, where the moment closure functions are obtained by first assuming that they exhibit a certain separable form, and then matching time derivatives of the exact (not closed) moment equations with that of the approximate (closed) equations for some initial time and set of initial conditions. However, for multi-species reactions these results have been restricted to second order truncations, i.e, M = 2. This paper extends these results by providing explicit formulas to construct moment closure functions for any arbitrary order of truncation M. We show that with increasing M the closed moment equations provide more accurate approximations to the exact moment equations. Striking features of these moment closure functions are that they are independent of the reaction parameters (reaction rates and stoichiometry) and moreover the dependence of higher-order moment on lower order ones is consistent with the population being jointly lognormally distributed. To illustrate the applicability of our results we consider a simple bi-molecular reaction. Moment estimates from a third order truncation are compared with estimates obtained from a large number of Monte Carlo simulations ...},

The algorithm, along with those in DASSL, is implemented in a new solver called DASPK. We outline the algorithms and strategies used, and discuss the use of the solver.

	Abstract = {Noise, or random fluctuations, in gene expression may produce variability in cellular behavior. To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell. We found that such noise is gene-specific and not dependent on the regulatory pathway or absolute rate of expression. We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression.},

The environment is represented by the state of the gene (active or inactive). The protein population size is ruled by the birth-and-death process. Proteins can be produced by the gene when it is activated (birth). They can disappear as well due to their denaturation (death). The distribution of the protein number is computed explicitly for both the transient and stationary cases. It is shown that three out of the four parameters of the model can be estimated from an observed sample of protein numbers collected during the stationary regime.},

	Abstract = {Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Robust estimation of kinetic parameters of intracellular processes requires large amounts of quantitative data. Due to the high uncertainty of such processes and the fact that recent single-cell measurement techniques have limited resolution and dimensionality, estimation should pool recordings of multiple cells of an isogenic cell population. However, experimental results have shown that several factors such as cell volume or cell-cycle stage can drastically affect signaling as well as protein expression, leading to inherent heterogeneities in the cell population measurements. Here we present a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for stochastic kinetic model calibration using heterogeneous cell population data. While obtaining optimal estimates for the rate constants, this approach allows to reconstruct missing species as well as to quantitatively capture extrinsic variability. The proposed algorithm is applied to a model of the osmo-stress induced MAPK Hog1 activation in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus.},

	Abstract = {Background
In radiation protection, biokinetic models for zirconium processing are of crucial importance in dose estimation and further risk analysis for humans exposed to this radioactive substance. They provide limiting values of detrimental effects and build the basis for applications in internal dosimetry, the prediction for radioactive zirconium retention in various organs as well as retrospective dosimetry. Multi-compartmental models are the tool of choice for simulating the processing of zirconium. Although easily interpretable, determining the exact compartment structure and interaction mechanisms is generally daunting. In the context of observing the dynamics of multiple compartments, Bayesian methods provide efficient tools for model inference and selection.

Results
We are the first to apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to compute Bayes factors for the evaluation of two competing models for zirconium processing in the human body after ingestion. Based on in vivo measurements of human plasma and urine levels we were able to show that a recently published model is superior to the standard model of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. The Bayes factors were estimated by means of the numerically stable thermodynamic integration in combination with a recently developed copula based Metropolis-Hastings sampler.

Conclusions
In contrast to the standard model the novel model predicts lower accretion of zirconium in bones. This results in lower levels of noxious doses for exposed individuals. Moreover, the Bayesian approach allows for retrospective dose assessment, including credible intervals for the initially ingested zirconium, in a significantly more reliable fashion than previously possible. All methods presented here are readily applicable to many modeling tasks in systems biology.},

	Abstract = {A Method of treating nonlinear Markov processes is discussed, based on the assumption that the variates are normally distributed. The method is applied to models of logistic population growth, plant competition, and animal predation. In the preparatory section (2) an alternative form (9) of the Bartlett relation is deduced, which is relatively convenient if one wishes to derive equations for the cumulants of a Markov process; the relation is particularly useful in the case of normal processes. In order that one may treat the joint distribution of the variate values at several instants of time, the Bartlett relation is generalized to provide equations (40) and (41) for the characteristic functional of the process. The validity of the "normalization technique" is discussed in the final section, and a comparison made with other methods.},

This model has a stable equilibrium distribution. The incorporation of immigration into the model, therefore, simplifies the qualitative nature of the stochastic solution. The (unconditional) cumulant functions for the transient and the equilibrium population size distributions are obtained, from which the distributions are shown to be near-normal at all times for the parameter values of interest. Approximating cumulant functions, which are relatively easy to find in practice, are derived and shown to be quite accurate, except for the case of massive immigration. As the level of immigration increases, the mean value rises more rapidly initially, as expected; however, the variance and the skewness of both the transient and the equilibrium distributions are reduced.},

	Abstract = {Continuous-time birth-death Markov processes serve as useful models in population biology. When the birth-death rates are nonlinear, the time evolution of the first n order moments of the population is not closed, in the sense that it depends on moments of order higher than n. For analysis purposes, the time evolution of the first n order moments is often made to be closed by approximating these higher order moments as a nonlinear function of moments up to order n, which we refer to as the moment closure function. In this paper, a systematic procedure for constructing moment closure functions of arbitrary order is presented for the stochastic logistic model. We obtain the moment closure function by first assuming a certain separable form for it, and then matching time derivatives of the exact (not closed) moment equations with that of the approximate (closed) equations for some initial time and set of initial conditions. The separable structure ensures that the steady-state solutions for the approximate equations are unique, real and positive, while the derivative matching guarantees a good approximation, at least locally in time. Explicit formulas to construct these moment closure functions for arbitrary order of truncation n are provided with higher values of n leading to better approximations of the actual moment dynamics. A host of other moment closure functions previously proposed in the literature are also investigated. Among these we show that only the ones that achieve derivative matching provide a close approximation to the exact solution. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of several previously proposed moment closure functions by forcing derivative matching.},

	Abstract = {Moment closure approximations are used to provide analytic approximations to non-linear stochastic population models. They often provide insights into model behaviour and help validate simulation results. However, existing closure schemes typically fail in situations where the population distribution is highly skewed or extinctions occur. In this study we address these problems by introducing novel second- and third-order moment closure approximations which we apply to the stochastic  and  epidemic models. In the case of the SI model, which has a highly skewed distribution of infection, we develop a second-order approximation based on the beta-binomial distribution. In addition, a closure approximation based on mixture distribution is developed in order to capture the behaviour of the stochastic SIS model around the threshold between persistence and extinction. This mixture approximation comprises a probability distribution designed to capture the quasi-equilibrium probabilities of the system and a probability mass at 0 which represents the probability of extinction. Two third-order versions of this mixture approximation are considered in which the log-normal and the beta-binomial are used to model the quasi-equilibrium distribution. Comparison with simulation results shows: (1) the beta-binomial approximation is flexible in shape and matches the skewness predicted by simulation as shown by the stochastic SI model and (2) mixture approximations are able to predict transient and extinction behaviour as shown by the stochastic SIS model, in marked contrast with existing approaches. We also apply our mixture approximation to approximate a likelihood function and carry out point and interval parameter estimation.},

	Abstract = {An important driver of gene regulatory networks is noise arising from the stochastic nature of interactions of genes, their products and regulators. Thus, such systems are stochastic and can be modelled by the chemical master equations. A major challenge is the curse of dimensionality which occurs when one attempts to integrate these equations. While stochastic simulation techniques effectively address the curse, many repeated simulations are required to provide precise information about stationary points, bifurcation phenomena and other properties of the stochastic processes. An alternative way to address the curse of dimensionality is provided by sparse grid approximations. The sparse grid methodology is applied and the application demonstrated to work efficiently for up to 10 proteins. As sparse grid methods have been developed for the approximation of smooth functions, a variant for infinite sequences had to be developed together with a multiresolution analysis similar to Haar wavelets. Error bounds are provided which confirm the effectiveness of sparse grid approximations for smooth high-dimensional probability distributions.

We derive a system of differential equations which describes the dynamics of means and all central moments from a chemical master equation. Truncating the system for the central moments at a certain moment term and using Taylor approximation, we obtain explicit representations of means and covariances and even higher central moments in recursive forms. This enables us to deal with the moments in successive differential equations and use conventional numerical methods for their approximations. Furthermore, we estimate the errors in the means and central moments generated by the approximation method. We also find the moments at equilibrium by solving truncated algebraic equations. We show in examples that numerical solutions based on the moment closure method are accurate and efficient by comparing the results to those of stochastic simulation algorithms.},

Solving this equation numerically, however, is usually extremely expensive or even impossible due to the huge size of the state space. Thus, the chemical master equation must often be replaced by a reduced model which operates with a considerably smaller number of degrees of freedom but hopefully still provides the essential information about the dynamics of the full system. We prove error bounds for two reduced models which have previously been proposed in the literature. Based on the error analysis, an alternative model reduction approach for the chemical master equation is introduced and discussed, and its advantage is illustrated by numerical examples.},

The availability of new platforms, allowing detection of increasing numbers of cell surface markers, has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual gating and resulted in a growing need for the development of automated, high-dimensional analytical methods. We present a direct multivariate finite mixture modeling approach, using skew and heavy-tailed distributions, to address the complexities of flow cytometric analysis and to deal with high-dimensional cytometric data without the need for projection or transformation. We demonstrate its ability to detect rare populations, to model robustly in the presence of outliers and skew, and to perform the critical task of matching cell populations across samples that enables downstream analysis. This advance will facilitate the application of flow cytometry to new, complex biological and clinical problems.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we derive estimates of productivity and survival from a model of a population of an endangered species and focus especially on the significance of predation. This model is based on an age structure of three classes: dependent young, juveniles, and adults differentiated by gender. In the first two classes, age is an independent variable and we use a partial-differential-equation framework for these age compartments. Assuming predation and natural death rates are independent of population size, it is possible to calculate analytically the threshold of the predation rate---especially on dependent young and juveniles---below which survival is assured and above which the cohort is doomed to extinction. The model leads to a linear-delay differential equation of a standard type. Transform techniques reveal that the transient behaviour will vary like exp(λt), where λ is related to a balance between birth rates and predation rates in various age classes. The sign of λ governs the behaviour, and λ equal to zero determines the threshold between survival and extinction for this model. The motivation for the development of this model is the need to determine the thresholds for survival of the kiwi, a flightless bird found only in New Zealand. Although protected, it is subject to extreme predation by introduced mammals and is declining throughout the mainland. The model shows that predation rates of kiwi are significantly above the threshold level required for survival, and that the species now needs to be managed to avert extinction. This methodology can be applied to other endangered species.},

	Abstract = {The specification of biological decisions by signaling pathways is encoded by the interplay between activation dynamics and network topologies. Although we can describe complex networks, we cannot easily determine which topology the cell actually uses to transduce a specific signal. Experimental testing of all plausible topologies is infeasible because of the combinatorially large number of experiments required to explore the complete hypothesis space. Here, we demonstrate that Bayesian inference--based modeling provides an approach to explore and constrain this hypothesis space, permitting the rational ranking of pathway models. Our approach can use measurements of a limited number of biochemical species when combined with multiple perturbations. As proof of concept, we examined the activation of the extracellular signal--regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by epidermal growth factor. The predicted and experimentally validated model shows that both Raf-1 and, unexpectedly, B-Raf are needed to fully activate ERK in two different cell lines. Thus, our formal methodology rationally infers evidentially supported pathway topologies even when a limited number of biochemical and kinetic measurements are available.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of gene regulatory variation is a key goal of evolutionary and medical genetics. Regulatory variation can act in an allele-specific manner (cis-acting) or it can affect both alleles of a gene (trans-acting). Differential allele-specific expression (ASE), in which the expression of one allele differs from another in a diploid, implies the presence of cis-acting regulatory variation. While microarrays and high-throughput sequencing have enabled genomewide measurements of transcriptional ASE, methods for measurement of protein ASE (pASE) have lagged far behind. We describe a flexible, accurate, and scalable strategy for measurement of pASE by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS).We apply this approach to a hybrid between the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus. Our results provide the first analysis of the relative contribution of cis-acting and trans-acting regulatory differences to protein expression divergence between yeast species.},

	Abstract = {The original green fluorescent protein (GFP) was discovered back in the early 1960s when researchers studying the bioluminescent properties of the Aequorea victoria jellyfish isolated a blue-light-emitting bioluminescent protein called aequorin together with another protein that was eventually named the green-fluorescent protein (Shimomura et al., 1962). Aequorin and GFP work together in the light organs of A. victoria to convert Ca2+-induced luminescent signals into the green luminescence that is characteristic of the species (Chalfie and Kain, 2006). After GFP was cloned (Prasher et al., 1992), it was first used for tracking gene expression in bacteria and the sensory neurons of the nematode C. elegans (Chalfie et al., 1994). Jellyfish-derived GFP has since been engineered to produce a vast number of useful blue, cyan and yellow mutants, and fluorescent proteins from a variety of other species have also been identified, resulting in further expansion of the available color palette into the orange, red and far-red spectral regions (Matz et al., 1999; Shaner et al., 2004; Shaner et al., 2008; Shcherbo et al., 2009). Together, these highly useful genetically encoded probes are broadly referred to as fluorescent proteins (FPs) (Davidson and Campbell, 2009; Rizzo et al., 2010; Shaner et al., 2007).

In this article and the accompanying poster, we will describe some of the general properties of FPs that are important to their function. We will also provide examples of successful mutagenesis that has been used to improve the use of these proteins for live-cell imaging, particularly for mammalian studies. Particular emphasis will be given to some of the most popular and/or best performing FPs in various spectral regions (blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red and far-red). Finally, we will briefly present some other applications of FPs, as well as outline anticipated future improvements. This short article is meant to provide a flavor of the power and limitations of fluorescent protein technologies; comprehensive reviews of their biochemistry (Tsien, 1998), their uses and available probes (Day and Davidson, 2009; Rizzo et al., 2010) are available elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

	Abstract = {Morphogenetic fields are among the most fundamental concepts of embryology. However, they are also among the most ill-defined, since they consist of dynamic regulatory processes whose exact nature remains elusive. In order to achieve a more rigorous definition of a developmental field, Lewis Wolpert introduced the concept of positional information illustrated by his French Flag model. Here we argue that Wolpert's positional information - a static coordinate system defining a field - lacks essential properties of the original field concept. We show how data-driven mathematical modeling approaches now enable us to study regulatory processes in a way that is qualitatively different from our previous level of understanding. As an example, we review our recent analysis of segmentation gene expression in the blastoderm embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Based on this analysis, we propose a revised French Flag, which incorporates the dynamic, feedback-driven nature of pattern formation in the Drosophila blastoderm.},

	Abstract = {To study the kinetics of lymphocytes, models have divided the cell population into subpopulations with different turnover rates. These have been called `kinetic heterogeneity models' so as to distinguish them from `temporal heterogeneity models', in which a cell population may have different turnover rates at different times, e.g. when resting versus when activated. We model labelling curves for temporally heterogeneous populations, and predict that they exhibit equal biphasic up- and downslopes. We show when cells divide only once upon activation, these slopes are dominated by the slowest exponent, yielding underestimates of the average turnover rate. When cells undergo more than one division, the labelling curves allow fitting of the two exponential slopes in the temporal heterogeneity model. The same data can also be described with a two-compartment kinetic heterogeneity model. In both instances, the average turnover rate is correctly estimated. Because both models assume a different cell biology but describe the data equally well, the parameters of either model have no simple biological interpretation, as each parameter could reflect a combination of parameters of another biological process. Thus, even if there are sufficient data to reliably estimate all exponentials, one can only accurately estimate an average turnover rate. We illustrate these issues by re-fitting labelling data from healthy and HIV-infected individuals.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Feedback circuits are important motifs in biological networks and part of virtually all regulation processes that are needed for a reliable functioning of the cell. Mathematically, feedback is connected to complex behavior of the systems, which is often related to bifurcations of fixed points. Therefore, several approaches for the investigation of fixed points in biological networks have been developed in recent years. Many of them assume the fixed point coordinates to be known, and an efficient way to calculate the entire set of fixed points for interrelated feedback structures is highly desirable.

RESULTS: In this article, we consider regulatory network models, which are differential equations with an underlying directed graph that illustrates independencies among variables. We introduce the circuit-breaking algorithm (CBA), a method that constructs one-dimensional characteristics for these network models, which inherit important information about the system. In particular, fixed points are related to the zeros of these characteristics. The CBA operates on the graph topology, and results from graph theory are used in order to make calculations efficient. Our framework provides a general scheme for analyzing network models in terms of interrelated feedback circuits. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a model for calcium oscillations based on experiments in hepatocytes, which consists of several interrelated feedback circuits.},

	Abstract = {The increasing availability and performance of automated scientific equipment in the past decades have brought about a revolution in the biological sciences. The ease with which data can now be generated has led to a new culture of high-throughput science, in which new types of biological questions can be asked and tackled in a systematic and unbiased manner. High-throughput microscopy, also often referred to as high-content screening (HCS), allows acquisition of systematic data at the single-cell level. Moreover, it allows the visualization of an enormous array of cellular features and provides tools to quantify a large number of parameters for each cell. These features make HCS a powerful method to create data that is rich and biologically meaningful without compromising systematic capabilities. In this Commentary, we will discuss recent work, which has used HCS, to demonstrate the diversity of applications and technological solutions that are evolving in this field. Such advances are placing HCS methodologies at the frontier of high-throughput science and enable scientists to combine throughput with content to address a variety of cell biological questions.},

	Abstract = {Background
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the capacity to self-renew and remain pluripotent, while continuously providing a source of a variety of differentiated cell types. Understanding what governs these properties at the molecular level is crucial for stem cell biology and its application to regenerative medicine. Of particular relevance is to elucidate those molecular interactions which govern the reprogramming of somatic cells into ESC. A computational approach can be used as a framework to explore the dynamics of a simplified network of the ESC with the aim to understand how stem cells differentiate and also how they can be reprogrammed from somatic cells.

Results
We propose a computational model of the embryonic stem cell network, in which a core set of transcription factors (TFs) interact with each other and are induced by external factors. A stochastic treatment of the network dynamics suggests that NANOG heterogeneity is the deciding factor for the stem cell fate. In particular, our results show that the decision of staying in the ground state or commitment to a differentiated state is fundamentally stochastic, and can be modulated by the addition of external factors (2i/3i media), which have the effect of reducing fluctuations in NANOG expression. Our model also hosts reprogramming of a committed cell into an ESC by over-expressing OCT4. In this context, we recapitulate the important experimental result that reprogramming efficiency peaks when OCT4 is over-expressed within a specific range of values.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated how a stochastic computational model based upon a simplified network of TFs in ESCs can elucidate several key observed dynamical features. It accounts for (i) the observed heterogeneity of key regulators, (ii) characterizes the ESC under certain external stimuli conditions and (iii) describes the occurrence of transitions from the ESC to the differentiated state. Furthermore, the model (iv) provides a framework for reprogramming from somatic cells and conveys an understanding of reprogramming efficiency as a function of OCT4 over-expression.},

	Abstract = {Background
Ordinary differential equations are widely-used in the field of systems biology and chemical engineering to model chemical reaction networks. Numerous techniques have been developed to estimate parameters like rate constants, initial conditions or steady state concentrations from time-resolved data. In contrast to this countable set of parameters, the estimation of entire courses of network components corresponds to an innumerable set of parameters.

Results
The approach presented in this work is able to deal with course estimation for extrinsic system inputs or intrinsic reactants, both not being constrained by the reaction network itself. Our method is based on variational calculus which is carried out analytically to derive an augmented system of differential equations including the unconstrained components as ordinary state variables. Finally, conventional parameter estimation is applied to the augmented system resulting in a combined estimation of courses and parameters.

Conclusions
The combined estimation approach takes the uncertainty in input courses correctly into account. This leads to precise parameter estimates and correct confidence intervals. In particular this implies that small motifs of large reaction networks can be analysed independently of the rest. By the use of variational methods, elements from control theory and statistics are combined allowing for future transfer of methods between the two fields.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a highly efficient parallel particle-mesh (PPM) library, based on a unifying particle formulation for the simulation of continuous systems. In this formulation, the grid-free character of particle methods is relaxed by the introduction of a mesh for the reinitialization of the particles, the computation of the field equations, and the discretization of differential operators. The present utilization of the mesh does not detract from the adaptivity, the efficient handling of complex geometries, the minimal dissipation, and the good stability properties of particle methods.
The coexistence of meshes and particles, allows for the development of a consistent and adaptive numerical method, but it presents a set of challenging parallelization issues that have hindered in the past the broader use of particle methods. The present library solves the key parallelization issues involving particle--mesh interpolations and the balancing of processor particle loading, using a novel adaptive tree for mixed domain decompositions along with a coloring scheme for the particle-mesh interpolation.
The high parallel efficiency of the library is demonstrated in a series of benchmark tests on distributed memory and on a shared-memory vector architecture. The modularity of the method is shown by a range of simulations, from compressible vortex rings using a novel formulation of smooth particle hydrodynamics, to simulations of diffusion in real biological cell organelles.
The present library enables large scale simulations of diverse physical problems using adaptive particle methods and provides a computational tool that is a viable alternative to mesh-based methods.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel adaptive-resolution particle method for continuous parabolic problems. In this method, particles self-organize in order to adapt to local resolution requirements. This is achieved by pseudo forces that are designed so as to guarantee that the solution is always well sampled and that no holes or clusters develop in the particle distribution. The particle sizes are locally adapted to the length scale of the solution. Differential operators are consistently evaluated on the evolving set of irregularly distributed particles of varying sizes using discretization-corrected operators. The method does not rely on any global transforms or mapping functions. After presenting the method and its error analysis, we demonstrate its capabilities and limitations on a set of two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems. These include advection-diffusion, the Burgers equation, the Buckley-Leverett five-spot problem, and curvature-driven level-set surface refinement.},

@phdthesis{GesteiraCostaFilho2008,
	Abstract = {The main focus of this thesis is the problem of finding groups of co-expressed genes from data obtained in DNA microarray experiments. As we assume co-expressed genes to: (1) perform related functional task, and (2) be regulated by the same transcription regulation program, such an analysis is helpful in identifying the biological function and the regulatory roles of genes. One traditional approach for finding co-expressed genes is the use of clustering methods. In this thesis, we use mixture models as a statistical formalism for clustering gene expression data. Mixture models are robust to noise, can model uncertainty about cluster assignments, allow the inclusion of prior knowledge, such as intrinsic dependencies of the experimental design, and offer a flexible framework for integration of additional biological data. In Chapter 2, we introduce the mixture model formalism. Then, in Chapter 3, we describe how mixture models can be used to solve the clustering problem, and how questions as choosing the number of clusters and cluster validation can be answered in the context of mixture models. Additionally, in Chapter 3 we propose a novel external index for validating clusterings computed by mixtures. Mixture models allow, with a proper choice of component models, to make explicit assumptions about the data. We propose here two novel types of components models for analyzing gene expression. The use of hidden Markov models with linear topologies to analyze gene expression time courses will be the focus of Chapter 4. With a benchmark data set, we show that mixture of HMMs have better class recovery than other methods proposed for time course analysis. In Chapter 5, we propose a new type of probabilistic model, dependence trees, to model gene expression profiles during a developmental process. We also explore the benefits of using priors of model parameters to obtain maximum-a-posteriori point estimates, and show how this improves the robustness of the method. For data collected in lymphoid development, mixtures of dependence trees compare favorably to other methods used for finding groups of co-expressed genes. Furthermore, by incorporating microRNA binding data, we identify promising novel regulatory roles of genes and their functional assignments. We propose in Chapter 6 an extension of the mixture model estimation. This semi-supervised learning can integrate additional biological data and improve clusterings of gene expression time-courses. We propose a novel method, which combines gene expression time-courses with spatial patterns of gene expression in Drosophila embryos, for finding groups of syn-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that the cluster results, obtained after integrating additional data, demonstrate a better recovery of syn-expressed genes then cluster results obtained with the gene expression data alone.},

	Abstract = {The numerical solution of chemical reactions described at the meso-scale is the topic of this thesis. This description, the master equation of chemical reactions, is an accurate model of reactions where stochastic effects are crucial for explaining certain effects observed in real life. In particular, this general equation is needed when studying processes inside living cells where other macro-scale models fail to reproduce the actual behavior of the system considered.

The main contribution of the thesis is the numerical investigation of two different methods for obtaining numerical solutions of the master equation. The first method produces statistical quantities of the solution and is a generalization of a frequently used macro-scale description. It is shown that the method is efficient while still being able to preserve stochastic effects.

By contrast, the other method obtains the full solution of the master equation and gains efficiency by an accurate representation of the state space. The thesis contains necessary background material as well as directions for intended future research. An important conclusion of the thesis is that, depending on the setup of the problem, methods of highly different character are needed.},

	Abstract = {Nanog is a divergent homeodomain protein found in mammalian pluripotent cells and developing germ cells. Deletion of Nanog causes early embryonic lethality, whereas constitutive expression enables autonomous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. Nanog is accordingly considered a core element of the pluripotent transcriptional network. However, here we report that Nanog fluctuates in mouse embryonic stem cells. Transient downregulation of Nanog appears to predispose cells towards differentiation but does not mark commitment. By genetic deletion we show that, although they are prone to differentiate, embryonic stem cells can self-renew indefinitely in the permanent absence of Nanog. Expanded Nanog null cells colonize embryonic germ layers and exhibit multilineage differentiation both in fetal and adult chimaeras. Although they are also recruited to the germ line, primordial germ cells lacking Nanog fail to mature on reaching the genital ridge. This defect is rescued by repair of the mutant allele. Thus Nanog is dispensible for expression of somatic pluripotency but is specifically required for formation of germ cells. Nanog therefore acts primarily in construction of inner cell mass and germ cell states rather than in the housekeeping machinery of pluripotency. We surmise that Nanog stabilizes embryonic stem cells in culture by resisting or reversing alternative gene expression states.},

	Abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

	Abstract = {This paper is as much about a certain modelling methodology, as it is about the constructive definition of future population states from a description of individual behaviour and an initial population state. The key idea is to build a nonlinear model in two steps, by explicitly introducing the environmental condition via the requirement that individuals are independent from one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed as a function of time. A linear physiologically structured population model is defined by two rules, one for reproduction and one for development and survival, both depending on the initial individual state and the prevailing environmental condition. In Part I we showed how one can constructively define future population state operators from these two ingredients. A nonlinear model is a linear model together with a feedback law that describes how the environmental condition at any particular time depends on the population size and composition at that time. When applied to the solution of the linear problem, the feedback law yields a fixed point problem. This we solve constructively by means of the contraction mapping principle, for any given initial population state. Using subsequently this fixed point as input in the linear population model, we obtain a population semiflow. We then say that we solved the nonlinear problem.},

	Abstract = {The chemical master equation (CME) is the fundamental evolution equation of the stochastic description of biochemical reaction kinetics. In most applications it is impossible to solve the CME directly due to its high dimensionality. Instead, indirect approaches based on realizations of the underlying Markov jump process are used, such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). In the SSA, however, every reaction event has to be resolved explicitly such that it becomes numerically inefficient when the system's dynamics include fast reaction processes or species with high population levels. In many hybrid approaches, such fast reactions are approximated as continuous processes or replaced by quasi-stationary distributions in either a stochastic or a deterministic context. Current hybrid approaches, however, almost exclusively rely on the computation of ensembles of stochastic realizations. We present a novel hybrid stochastic--deterministic approach to solve the CME directly. Our starting point is a partitioning of the molecular species into discrete and continuous species that induces a partitioning of the reactions into discrete--stochastic and continuous--deterministic processes. The approach is based on a WKB (Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin) ansatz for the conditional probability distribution function (PDF) of the continuous species (given a discrete state) in combination with Laplace's method of integral approximation. The resulting hybrid stochastic--deterministic evolution equations comprise a CME with averaged propensities for the PDF of the discrete species that is coupled to an evolution equation of the related expected levels of the continuous species for each discrete state. In contrast to indirect hybrid methods, the impact of the evolution of discrete species on the dynamics of the continuous species has to be taken into account explicitly. The proposed approach is efficient whenever the number of discrete molecular species is small. We illustrate the performance of the new hybrid stochastic--deterministic approach in an application to model systems of biological interest.},

	Abstract = {The isthmic organizer mediating differentiation of mid- and hindbrain during vertebrate development is characterized by a well-defined pattern of locally restricted gene expression domains around the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB). This pattern is established and maintained by a regulatory network between several transcription and secreted factors that is not yet understood in full detail. In this contribution we show that a Boolean analysis of the characteristic spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB reveals key regulatory interactions in this network. Our analysis employs techniques from computational logic for the minimization of Boolean functions. This approach allows us to predict also the interplay of the various regulatory interactions. In particular, we predict a maintaining, rather than inducing, effect of Fgf8 on Wnt1 expression, an issue that remained unclear from published data. Using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures, we provide experimental evidence that Fgf8 in fact only maintains but does not induce ectopic Wnt1 expression in these explants. In combination with previously validated interactions, this finding allows for the construction of a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB. Analyses of Boolean, differential equation and reactiondiffusion models of this network confirm that it is indeed able to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB as well as timecourses of expression patterns both under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that similar to temporal also spatial expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks. We show, in particular, that the spatial gene expression patterns around the MHB help us to understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.},

If the sources of heterogeneity are observed (e.g., gender), the sample can be split into groups and the data analyzed with methods for multiple groups. If the sources of population heterogeneity are unobserved, the data can be analyzed with latent class models. Factor mixture models are a combination of latent class and common factor models and can be used to explore unobserved population heterogeneity. Observed sources of heterogeneity can be included as covariates. The different ways to incorporate covariates correspond to different conceptual interpretations. These are discussed in detail. Characteristics of factor mixture modeling are described in comparison to other methods designed for data stemming from heterogeneous populations. A step-by-step analysis of a subset of data from the Longitudinal Survey of American Youth illustrates how factor mixture models can be applied in an exploratory fashion to data collected at a single time point.},

	Abstract = {Increasingly complex applications involve large datasets in combination with nonlinear and high dimensional mathematical models. In this context, statistical inference is a challenging issue that calls for pragmatic approaches that take advantage of both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The elegance of Bayesian methodology is founded in the propagation of information content provided by experimental data and prior assumptions to the posterior probability distribution of model predictions. However, for complex applications experimental data and prior assumptions potentially constrain the posterior probability distribution insuciently. In these situations Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be infeasible. From a frequentist point of view insucient experimental data and prior assumptions can be interpreted as non-identifiability. The profile likelihood approach offers to detect and to resolve non-identifiability by experimental design iteratively. Therefore, it allows one to better constrain the posterior probability distribution until Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be used securely. Using an application from cell biology we compare both methods and show that a successive application of both methods facilitates a realistic assessment of uncertainty in model predictions.},

@article{DaigleJrRoh2012,
	Abstract = {Background
A prerequisite for the mechanistic simulation of a biochemical system is detailed knowledge of its kinetic parameters. Despite recent experimental advances, the estimation of unknown parameter values from observed data is still a bottleneck for obtaining accurate simulation results. Many methods exist for parameter estimation in deterministic biochemical systems; methods for discrete stochastic systems are less well developed. Given the probabilistic nature of stochastic biochemical models, a natural approach is to choose parameter values that maximize the probability of the observed data with respect to the unknown parameters, a.k.a. the maximum likelihood parameter estimates (MLEs). MLE computation for all but the simplest models requires the simulation of many system trajectories that are consistent with experimental data. For models with unknown parameters, this presents a computational challenge, as the generation of consistent trajectories can be an extremely rare occurrence.

Results
We have developed Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization with Modified Cross-Entropy Method (MCEM2): an accelerated method for calculating MLEs that combines advances in rare event simulation with a computationally efficient version of theMonte Carlo expectationmaximization (MCEM) algorithm. Our method requires no prior knowledge regarding parameter values, and it automatically provides a multivariate parameter uncertainty estimate. We applied the method to five stochastic systems of increasing complexity, progressing from an analytically tractable pure-birth model to a computationally demanding model of yeastpolarization. Our results demonstrate that MCEM2 substantially accelerates MLE computation on all tested models when compared to a stand-alone version of MCEM. Additionally, we show how our method identifies parameter values for certain classes of models more accurately than two recently proposed computationally efficient methods.

Conclusions
This work provides a novel, accelerated version of a likelihood-based parameter estimation method that can be readily applied to stochastic biochemical systems. In addition, our results suggest opportunities for added efficiency improvements that will further enhance our ability to mechanistically simulate biological processes.

	Abstract = {The dynamics of biochemical reaction networks can be accurately described by stochastic hybrid models, where we assume that large chemical populations evolve deterministically and continuously over time while small populations change through random discrete reactions.

We propose an algorithm for estimating the parameters of a given biochemical reaction network based on a stochastic hybrid model. We assume that noisy time series measurements of the chemical populations are available and follow a maximum likelihood approach to calibrate the parameters. We numerically approximate the likelihood and its derivatives for concrete values of the parameters and show that, based on this approximation, the maximization of the likelihood can be done efficiently.

We substantiate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to several case studies from systems biology.},

	Abstract = {Derived from the Markov character only, the master equation of chemical reactions is an accurate stochastic description of quite general systems in chemistry. Exact solutions of this equation are rare and the most frequently used approximative solution method is to write down the corresponding set of reaction rate equations. In many cases this approximation is not valid, or only partially so, as stochastic effects caused by the natural noise present in the full description of the problem are poorly captured. In this paper it is shown how a certain set of higher order equations can be derived. It is shown by theory and example that  stochastic effects are better captured using this technique while still maintaining the computational advantages of the reaction rate approach.},

	Abstract = {Mice homozygous for null alleles of the putative signalingmolecule Wnt-1 have a reproducible phenotype: loss of the midbrain and adjacent cerebellar component of the metencephalon. By examining embryonic expression of the mouse engrailed (En) genes, from 8.0 to 9.5 days postcoitum, we demonstrate that Wnt-1 primarily regulates midbrain development. The midbrain itself is required for normal development of the metencephalon. Thus, the observed neonatal phenotype is explained by a series of early events, within 48 hr of neural plate induction, that leads to a complete loss of En domains in the anterior central nervous system. Wnt-1 and a related gene, Wnt-3a, are coexpressed from early somite stages in dorsal aspects of the myelencephalon and spinal cord. We suggest that functional redundancy between these two genes accounts forthe lack of a caudal central nervous system phenotype.},

Our discussion focuses on pathways involving `signals' rather than metabolites. In this context, physicochemical modelling is a natural extension of informal or conceptual pathway modelling. Formal modelling is much more powerful in putting molecular detail in a physiological context, uncovering principles of biological design and creating dynamic repositories of interpretable knowledge. However, to realize this power, challenges inherent in construction, verification, calibration, interpretation and publication of models must be addressed.},

	Abstract = {We investigate a three-dimensional multiscale model of vascular tumour growth, which couples blood flow, angiogenesis,
vascular remodelling, nutrient/growth factor transport, movement of, and interactions between, normal and tumour cells,
and nutrient-dependent cell cycle dynamics within each cell. In particular, we determine how the domain size, aspect ratio
and initial vascular network influence the tumour's growth dynamics and its long-time composition. We establish whether it
is possible to extrapolate simulation results obtained for small domains to larger ones, by constructing a large simulation
domain from a number of identical subdomains, each subsystem initially comprising two parallel parent vessels, with
associated cells and diffusible substances. We find that the subsystem is not representative of the full domain and conclude
that, for this initial vessel geometry, interactions between adjacent subsystems contribute to the overall growth dynamics.
We then show that extrapolation of results from a small subdomain to a larger domain can only be made if the subdomain
is sufficiently large and is initialised with a sufficiently complex vascular network. Motivated by these results, we perform
simulations to investigate the tumour's response to therapy and show that the probability of tumour elimination in a larger
domain can be extrapolated from simulation results on a smaller domain. Finally, we demonstrate how our model may be
combined with experimental data, to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of a vascular tumour.},

	Abstract = {Mutation and expression studies have implicated the Wnt gene family in early developmental decision making in vertebrates and flies. In a detailed comparative analysis, we have used in situ hybridization of 8.0- to 9.5-day mouse embryos to characterize expression of all ten published Wnt genes in the central nervous system (CNS) and limb buds. Seven of the family members show restricted expression patterns in the brain. At least three genes (Wnt-3, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-7b) exhibit sharp boundaries of expression in the forebrain that may predict subdivisions of the region later in development. In the spinal cord, Wnt-1, Wnt-3, and Wnt-3a are expressed dorsally, Wnt-5a, Wnt-7a, and Wnt-7b more ventrally, and Wnt-4 both dorsally and in the floor plate. In the forelimb primordia, Wnt-3, Wnt-4, Wnt-6 and Wnt-7b are expressed fairly uniformly throughout the limb ectoderm. Wnt-5a RNA is distributed in a proximal to distal gradient through the limb mesenchyme and ectoderm. Along the limb's dorsal-ventral axis, Wnt-5a is expressed in the ventral ectoderm and Wnt-7a in the dorsal ectoderm. We discuss the significance of these patterns of restricted and partially overlapping domains of expression with respect to the putative function of Wnt signalling in early CNS and limb development.},

@article{ToniJov2011,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Bacteria have evolved a rich set of mechanisms for sensing and adapting to adverse conditions in their environment. These are crucial for their survival, which requires them to react to extracellular stresses such as heat shock, ethanol treatment or phage infection. Here we focus on studying the phage shock protein (Psp) stress response in Escherichia coli induced by a phage infection or other damage to the bacterial membrane. This system has not yet been theoretically modelled or analysed in silico.

RESULTS:
We develop a model of the Psp response system, and illustrate how such models can be constructed and analyzed in light of available sparse and qualitative information in order to generate novel biological hypotheses about their dynamical behaviour. We analyze this model using tools from Petri-net theory and study its dynamical range that is consistent with currently available knowledge by conditioning model parameters on the available data in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. Within this ABC approach we analyze stochastic and deterministic dynamics. This analysis allows us to identify different types of behaviour and these mechanistic insights can in turn be used to design new, more detailed and time-resolved experiments.

CONCLUSIONS:
We have developed the first mechanistic model of the Psp response in E. coli. This model allows us to predict the possible qualitative stochastic and deterministic dynamic behaviours of key molecular players in the stress response. Our inferential approach can be applied to stress response and signalling systems more generally: in the ABC framework we can condition mathematical models on qualitative data in order to delimit e.g. parameter ranges or the qualitative system dynamics in light of available end-point or qualitative information.},

	Abstract = {Recent computational studies indicate that the molecular noise of a cellular process may be a rich source of information about process dynamics and parameters. However, accessing this source requires stochastic models that are usually difficult to analyze. Therefore, parameter estimation for stochastic systems using distribution measurements, as provided for instance by flow cytometry, currently remains limited to very small and simple systems. Here we propose a new method that makes use of low-order moments of the measured distribution and thereby keeps the essential parts of the provided information, while still staying applicable to systems of realistic size. We demonstrate how cell-to-cell variability can be incorporated into the analysis obviating the need for the ubiquitous assumption that the measurements stem from a homogeneous cell population. We demonstrate the method for a simple example of gene expression using synthetic data generated by stochastic simulation. Subsequently, we use time-lapsed flow cytometry data for the osmo-stress induced transcriptional response in budding yeast to calibrate a stochastic model, which is then used as a basis for predictions. Our results show that measurements of the mean and the variance can be enough to determine the model parameters, even if the measured distributions are not well-characterized by low-order moments only--e.g., if they are bimodal.},

	Abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis--Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

	Abstract = {The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefficients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems.

We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identification from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in significant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks.

	Abstract = {Phenotypic variation is ubiquitous in biology and is often traceable to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression ``noise,'' has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive ``fingerprint'' with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

	Abstract = {In response to stimulation, B lymphocytes pursue a large number of distinct fates important for immune regulation. Whether each cell's fate is determined by external direction, internal stochastic processes, or directed asymmetric division is unknown. Measurement of times to isotype switch, to develop into a plasmablast, and to divide or to die for thousands of cells indicated that each fate is pursued autonomously and stochastically. As a consequence of competition between these processes, censorship of alternative outcomes predicts intricate correlations that are observed in the data. Stochastic competition can explain how the allocation of a proportion of B cells to each cell fate is achieved. The B cell may exemplify how other complex cell differentiation systems are controlled.},

	Abstract = {Much has been made of the idea that asymmetric cell division is a defining characteristic of stem cells that enables them to simultaneously perpetuate themselves (self-renew) and generate differentiated progeny. Yet many stem cells can divide symmetrically, particularly when they are expanding in number during development or after injury. Thus, asymmetric division is not necessary for stem-cell identity but rather is a tool that stem cells can use to maintain appropriate numbers of progeny. The facultative use of symmetric or asymmetric divisions by stem cells may be a key adaptation that is crucial for adult regenerative capacity.},

	Abstract = {Receptor-mediated apoptosis proceeds via two pathways: one requiring only a cascade of initiator and effector caspases (type I behavior) and the second requiring an initiator-effector caspase cascade and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (type II behavior). Here, we investigate factors controlling type I versus II phenotypes by performing Lyapunov exponent analysis of an ODE-based model of cell death. The resulting phase diagrams predict that the ratio of XIAP to pro-caspase-3 concentrations plays a key regulatory role: type I behavior predominates when the ratio is low and type II behavior when the ratio is high. Cell-to-cell variability in phenotype is observed when the ratio is close to the type I versus II boundary. By positioning multiple tumor cell lines on the phase diagram we confirm these predictions. We also extend phase space analysis to mutations affecting the rate of caspase-3 ubiquitylation by XIAP, predicting and showing that such mutations abolish all-or-none control over activation of effector caspases. Thus, phase diagrams derived from Lyapunov exponent analysis represent a means to study multi-factorial control over a complex biochemical pathway.},

	Abstract = {The DNA replication--division cycle of eukaryotic cells is controlled by a complex network of regulatory proteins, called cyclin-dependent kinases, and their activators and inhibitors. Although comprehensive and accurate deterministic models of the control system are available for yeast cells, reliable stochastic simulations have not been carried out because the full reaction network has yet to be expressed in terms of elementary reaction steps. As a first step in this direction, we present a simplified version of the control system that is suitable for exact stochastic simulation of intrinsic noise caused by molecular fluctuations and extrinsic noise because of unequal division. The model is consistent with many characteristic features of noisy cell cycle progression in yeast populations, including the observation that mRNAs are present in very low abundance (≈1 mRNA molecule per cell for each expressed gene). For the control system to operate reliably at such low mRNA levels, some specific mRNAs in our model must have very short half-lives (<1 min). If these mRNA molecules are longer-lived (perhaps 2 min), then the intrinsic noise in our simulations is too large, and there must be some additional noise suppression mechanisms at work in cells.},

	Abstract = {We present a computational method for identifying potential targets of a transcription factor (TF) using wild-type gene expression time series data. For each putative target gene we fit a simple differential equation model of transcriptional regulation, and the model likelihood serves as a score to rank targets. The expression profile of the TF is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process prior distribution that is integrated out using a nonparametric Bayesian procedure. This results in a parsimonious model with relatively few parameters that can be applied to short time series datasets without noticeable overfitting. We assess our method using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) and loss-of-function mutant expression data for two TFs, Twist, and Mef2, controlling mesoderm development in Drosophila. Lists of top-ranked genes identified by our method are significantly enriched for genes close to bound regions identified in the ChIP-chip data and for genes that are differentially expressed in loss-of-function mutants. Targets of Twist display diverse expression profiles, and in this case a model-based approach performs significantly better than scoring based on correlation with TF expression. Our approach is found to be comparable or superior to ranking based on mutant differential expression scores. Also, we show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial expression data can further improve target ranking performance.},

	Abstract = {A toggle switch consists of two genes that mutually repress each other. This regulatory motif is active during cell differentiation and is thought to act as a memory device, being able to choose and maintain cell fate decisions. Commonly, this switch has been modeled in a deterministic framework where transcription and translation are lumped together. In this description, bistability occurs for transcription factor cooperativity, whereas autoactivation leads to a tristable system with an additional undecided state. In this contribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene expression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties of the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA numbers, high protein abundance, and monomeric transcription-factor binding. Contrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows complex multiattractor dynamics without autoactivation and cooperativity. Most importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a probabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and primed states in cell differentiation. To begin, we study the dynamics of the system and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using both the quasipotential and the probability flux of the system. Next, we show that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors are geometrically distributed. We derive an analytical expression for the parameter of the geometric distribution, therefore completely describing the statistics of the switching process and elucidate the influence of the system parameters on the residence time. Moreover, we find that the mean residence time increases linearly with the mean protein level. This scaling also holds for a one-stage scenario and for autoactivation. Finally, we study the implications of this distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of the stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism. Our model explains lineage priming and proposes the need of either high protein numbers or long-term modifications such as chromatin remodeling to achieve stable cell fate decisions. Notably, we present a system with high protein abundance that nevertheless requires a probabilistic description to exhibit multistability, complex switching dynamics, and lineage priming.},

	Abstract = {An increasing number of small RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to regulate critical pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In bacteria, regulation by trans-encoded sRNAs is predominantly found in the coordination of intricate stress responses. The mechanisms by which sRNAs modulate expression of its targets are diverse. In common to most is the possibility that interference with the translation of mRNA targets may also alter the abundance of functional sRNAs. Aiming to understand the unique role played by sRNAs in gene regulation, we studied examples from two distinct classes of bacterial sRNAs in Escherichia coli using a quantitative approach combining experiment and theory. Our results demonstrate that sRNA provides a novel mode of gene regulation, with characteristics distinct from those of protein-mediated gene regulation. These include a threshold-linear response with a tunable threshold, a robust noise resistance characteristic, and a built-in capability for hierarchical cross-talk. Knowledge of these special features of sRNA-mediated regulation may be crucial toward understanding the subtle functions that sRNAs can play in coordinating various stress-relief pathways. Our results may also help guide the design of synthetic genetic circuits that have properties difficult to attain with protein regulators alone.},

The optimalcontrol represents the drug dosage over a fixed length of time. We give evidence that the discrete scheme, derived from our model, is consistent; moreover, the continuous dependence of the solution with respect to the initial data is proved. We prove the existence of an optimalcontrol providing a unique solution to our model. Numerical simulations show that the division rate of leukemic HSC plays a crucial role when determining the optimalcontrol. When the division rate decrease with age of cells, drug therapy should be administered at full dosage at the beginning. Next, it is piecewise continuous in time. When older leukemic HSC have a larger capacity of division, the optimal dosage increases to the maximum value, and then decreases over time.},

@article{SunnakerSch2011,
	Abstract = {Background
Systems biology models tend to become large since biological systems often consist of complex networks of interacting components, and since the models usually are developed to reflect various mechanistic assumptions of those networks. Nevertheless, not all aspects of the model are equally interesting in a given setting, and normally there are parts that can be reduced without affecting the relevant model performance. There are many methods for model reduction, but few or none of them allow for a restoration of the details of the original model after the simplified model has been simulated.

Results
We present a reduction method that allows for such a back-translation from the reduced to the original model. The method is based on lumping of states, and includes a general and formal algorithm for both determining appropriate lumps, and for calculating the analytical back-translation formulas. The lumping makes use of efficient methods from graph-theory and ϵ-decomposition and is derived and exemplified on two published models for fluorescence emission in photosynthesis. The bigger of these models is reduced from 26 to 6 states, with a negligible deviation from the reduced model simulations, both when comparing simulations in the states of the reduced model and when comparing back-translated simulations in the states of the original model. The method is developed in a linear setting, but we exemplify how the same concepts and approaches can be applied to non-linear problems. Importantly, the method automatically provides a reduced model with back-translations. Also, the method is implemented as a part of the systems biology toolbox for matlab, and the matlab scripts for the examples in this paper are available in the supplementary material.

Conclusions
Our novel lumping methodology allows for both automatic reduction of states using lumping, and for analytical retrieval of the original states and parameters without performing a new simulation. The two models can thus be considered as two degrees of zooming of the same model. This is a conceptually new development of model reduction approaches, which we think will stimulate much further research and will prove to be very useful in future modelling projects.

	Abstract = {Unless diagnosed early, many adult cancers remain incurable diseases. This is despite an intense global research effort to develop effective anticancer therapies, calling into question the use of rational drug design strategies in targeting complex disease states such as cancer. A fundamental challenge facing researchers and clinicians is that cancers are inherently robust biological systems, able to survive, adapt and proliferate despite the perturbations resulting from anticancer drugs. It is essential that the mechanisms underlying tumor robustness be formally studied and characterized, as without a thorough understanding of the principles of tumor robustness, strategies to overcome therapy resistance are unlikely to be found. Degeneracy describes the ability of structurally distinct system components (e.g. proteins, pathways, cells, organisms) to be conditionally interchangeable in their contribution to system traits and it has been broadly implicated in the robustness and evolvability of complex biological systems. Here we focus on one of the most important mechanisms underpinning tumor robustness and degeneracy, the cellular heterogeneity that is the hallmark of most solid tumors. Based on a combination of computational, experimental and clinical studies we argue that stochastic noise is an underlying cause of tumor heterogeneity and particularly degeneracy. Drawing from a number of recent data sets, we propose an integrative model for the evolution of therapy resistance, and discuss recent computational studies that propose new therapeutic strategies aimed at defeating the adaptable cancer phenotype.},

	Abstract = {In individual mammalian cells the expression of some genes such as prolactin is highly variable over time and has been suggested to occur in stochastic pulses. To investigate the origins of this behavior and to understand its functional relevance, we quantitatively analyzed this variability using new mathematical tools that allowed us to reconstruct dynamic transcription rates of different reporter genes controlled by identical promoters in the same living cell. Quantitative microscopic analysis of two reporter genes, firefly luciferase and destabilized EGFP, was used to analyze the dynamics of prolactin promoter-directed gene expression in living individual clonal and primary pituitary cells over periods of up to 25 h. We quantified the time-dependence and cyclicity of the transcription pulses and estimated the length and variation of active and inactive transcription phases. We showed an average cycle period of approximately 11 h and demonstrated that while the measured time distribution of active phases agreed with commonly accepted models of transcription, the inactive phases were differently distributed and showed strong memory, with a refractory period of transcriptional inactivation close to 3 h. Cycles in transcription occurred at two distinct prolactin-promoter controlled reporter genes in the same individual clonal or primary cells. However, the timing of the cycles was independent and out-of-phase. For the first time, we have analyzed transcription dynamics from two equivalent loci in real-time in single cells. In unstimulated conditions, cells showed independent transcription dynamics at each locus. A key result from these analyses was the evidence for a minimum refractory period in the inactive-phase of transcription. The response to acute signals and the result of manipulation of histone acetylation was consistent with the hypothesis that this refractory period corresponded to a phase of chromatin remodeling which significantly increased the cyclicity. Stochastically timed bursts of transcription in an apparently random subset of cells in a tissue may thus produce an overall coordinated but heterogeneous phenotype capable of acute responses to stimuli.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, cell population models have become increasingly common. In contrast to classic single cell models, population models allow for the study of cell-to-cell variability, a crucial phenomenon in most populations of primary cells, cancer cells, and stem cells. Unfortunately, tools for in-depth analysis of population models are still missing. This problem originates from the complexity of population models. Particularly important are methods to determine the source of heterogeneity (e.g., genetics or epigenetic differences) and to select potential (bio-)markers. We propose an analysis based on visual analytics to tackle this problem. Our approach combines parallel-coordinates plots, used for a visual assessment of the high-dimensional dependencies, and nonlinear support vector machines, for the quantification of effects. The method can be employed to study qualitative and quantitative differences among cells. To illustrate the different components, we perform a case study using the proapoptotic signal transduction pathway involved in cellular apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {nderstanding cellular regulation processes at a molecular and systems
	level requires quantitative dynamic modeling approaches. Systems
	of ordinary dierential equations are commonly used for this purpose.
	The inverse problem to estimate parameters of these models from experimental
	data unfortunately poses several challenges, e.g. concerning computational
	costs and identiability issues. In this paper we focus on a maximum
	likelihood based approach for parameter estimation from relative
	measurement data, meaning that the model outputs are proportional
	to internal model states but the proportionality factors are unknown.
	We introduce a novel method to reduce the dimensionality of the respective
	optimization problem and to solve it effciently. Furthermore, the
	method of profile likelihoods is established to study the reliability
	of point estimates and identifiability problems which arise then
	considering relative instead of absolute data. Our approaches are
	evaluated on two biological network models. Keywords: Parameter estimation,
	identifiability, relative data, profile likelihood, confidence intervals,
	biological networks.},

Cell synchronization techniques have been generally employed to minimize the variation in cell cycle position. However, synchronization techniques are cumbersome and imprecise and the agents used to synchronize the cells potentially have other unknown effects on the cells. An alternative approach is to determine the age structure in the population and account for the cell cycle positional effects post hoc. Here we provide a formalism to use quantifiable age distributions from live cell microscopy experiments to parameterize an age-structured model of cell population response.},

	Abstract = {Stem cells dynamics is an important field of research with promising clinical impacts. Due to the revolutionary new technologies of biological data collection, an enormous amount of information on specific factors and genes responsible for cell differentiation is available. However, the mechanisms controlling stem cell self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation are still poorly understood and there exists no general characterization of stem cells based on observable cell properties. We address these problems with the help of mathematical models. Stem cells are described as the cell type that is most responsive to certain environmental signals. This results in a dynamic characterization of stemness that depends on environmental conditions and is not necessarily linked to a unique cell population.},

	Abstract = {We consider the interaction between a general size-structured consumer population and an unstructured resource. We show that stability properties and bifurcation phenomena can be understood in terms of solutions of a system of two delay equations (a renewal equation for the consumer population birth rate coupled to a delay differential equation for the resource concentration). As many results for such systems are available (Diekmann et al. in SIAM J Math Anal 39:1023-1069, 2007), we can draw rigorous conclusions concerning dynamical behaviour from an analysis of a characteristic equation. We derive the characteristic equation for a fairly general class of population models, including those based on the Kooijman-Metz Daphnia model (Kooijman and Metz in Ecotox Env Saf 8:254-274, 1984; de Roos et al. in J Math Biol 28:609-643, 1990) and a model introduced by Gurney-Nisbet (Theor Popul Biol 28:150-180, 1985) and Jones et al.

	Abstract = {Our systematic formulation of nonlinear population models is based on the notion of the environmental condition. The defining property of the environmental condition is that individuals are independent of one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed (in principle as an arbitrary function of time, but when focussing on steady states we shall restrict to constant functions). The steady-state problem has two components: (i). the environmental condition should be such that the existing populations do neither grow nor decline; (ii). a feedback consistency condition relating the environmental condition to the community/population size and composition should hold. In this paper we develop, justify and analyse basic formalism under the assumption that individuals can be born in only finitely many possible states and that the environmental condition is fully characterized by finitely many numbers. The theory is illustrated by many examples. In addition to various simple toy models introduced for explanation purposes, these include a detailed elaboration of a cannibalism model and a general treatment of how genetic and physiological structure should be combined in a single model.},

The approach extends and completes the method presented in Chib (1995) by overcoming the problems associated with the presence of intractable full conditional densities. The proposed method is developed in the context of MCMC chains produced by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, whose building blocks are used both for sampling and marginal likelihood estimation, thus economizing on prerun tuning effort and programming. Experiments involving the logit model for binary data, hierarchical random effects model for clustered Gaussian data, Poisson regression model for clustered count data, and the multivariate probit model for correlated binary data, are used to illustrate the performance and implementation of the method. These examples demonstrate that the method is practical and widely applicable.},

@article{TayHug2010,
	Abstract = {Cells operate in dynamic environments using extraordinary communication capabilities that emerge from the interactions of genetic circuitry. The mammalian immune response is a striking example of the coordination of different cell types. Cell-to-cell communication is primarily mediated by signalling molecules that form spatiotemporal concentration gradients, requiring cells to respond to a wide range of signal intensities. Here we use high-throughput microfluidic cell culture and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative gene expression analysis and mathematical modelling to investigate how single mammalian cells respond to different concentrations of the signalling molecule tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and relay information to the gene expression programs by means of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. We measured NF-kappaB activity in thousands of live cells under TNF-α doses covering four orders of magnitude. We find, in contrast to population-level studies with bulk assays, that the activation is heterogeneous and is a digital process at the single-cell level with fewer cells responding at lower doses. Cells also encode a subtle set of analogue parameters to modulate the outcome; these parameters include NF-kappaB peak intensity, response time and number of oscillations. We developed a stochastic mathematical model that reproduces both the digital and analogue dynamics as well as most gene expression profiles at all measured conditions, constituting a broadly applicable model for TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signalling in various types of cells. These results highlight the value of high-throughput quantitative measurements with single-cell resolution in understanding how biological systems operate.},

	Abstract = {Helper T (Th) cell differentiation is highly regulated by cytokines but initiated by mitogens. By examining gene expression in discrete generations of dividing cells, we have delineated the relationship between proliferation and differentiation. Initial expression of IL-2 is cell cycle-independent, whereas effector cytokine expression is cell cycle-dependent. IFNγ expression increases in frequency with successive cell cycles, while IL-4 expression requires three cell divisions. Cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to relieve epigenetic repression and can be supplanted by agents that hyperacetylate histones and demethylate DNA. Terminally differentiated cells exhibit stable epigenetic modification and cell cycle-independent gene expression. These data reveal a novel mechanism governing Th cell fate that initially integrates proliferative and differentiative signals and subsequently maintains stability of the differentiated state.},

In budding yeast, buds are made young whereas ageing factors, such as carbonylated proteins and DNA circles, remain confined to the ageing mother cell. The mechanisms of this confinement and their relevance are poorly understood. Here we show that a septin-dependent, lateral diffusion barrier forms in the nuclear envelope and limits the translocation of pre-existing nuclear pores into the bud. The retention of DNA circles within the mother cell depends on the presence of the diffusion barrier and on the anchorage of the circles to pores mediated by the nuclear basket. In accordance with the diffusion barrier ensuring the asymmetric segregation of nuclear age-determinants, the barrier mutant bud6Δ fails to properly reset age in buds. Our data involve septin-dependent diffusion barriers in the confinement of ageing factors to one daughter cell during asymmetric cell division.},

	Abstract = {Background
The creation and modification of genome-scale metabolic models is a task that requires specialized software tools. While these are available, subsequently running or visualizing a model often relies on disjoint code, which adds additional actions to the analysis routine and, in our experience, renders these applications suboptimal for routine use by (systems) biologists.

Results
The Flux Analysis and Modeling Environment (FAME) is the first web-based modeling tool that combines the tasks of creating, editing, running, and analyzing/visualizing stoichiometric models into a single program. Analysis results can be automatically superimposed on familiar KEGG-like maps. FAME is written in PHP and uses the Python-based PySCeS-CBM for its linear solving capabilities. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a quick-start tutorial, and can be accessed online at http://f-a-m-e.org/.

Conclusions
With FAME, we present the community with an open source, user-friendly, web-based "one stop shop" for stoichiometric modeling. We expect the application will be of substantial use to investigators and educators alike.},

	Abstract = {From molecules in cells to organisms in ecosystems, biological populations fluctuate due to the intrinsic randomness of individual events and the extrinsic influence of changing environments. The combined effect is often too complex for effective analysis, and many studies therefore make simplifying assumptions, for example ignoring either intrinsic or extrinsic effects to reduce the number of model assumptions. Here we mathematically demonstrate how two identical and independent reporters embedded in a shared fluctuating environment can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic noise terms, but also how these contributions are qualitatively and quantitatively different from what has been previously reported. Furthermore, we show for which classes of biological systems the noise contributions identified by dual-reporter methods correspond to the noise contributions predicted by correct stochastic models of either intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms. We find that for broad classes of systems, the extrinsic noise from the dual-reporter method can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore intrinsic stochasticity. In contrast, the intrinsic noise can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore extrinsic stochasticity only under very special conditions that rarely hold in biology. Testing whether the conditions are met is rarely possible and the dual-reporter method may thus produce flawed conclusions about the properties of the system, particularly about the intrinsic noise. Our results contribute toward establishing a rigorous framework to analyze dynamically fluctuating biological systems.},

Two established problems in the modeling of biological processes are model selection and the estimation of associated parameters. A number of statistical approaches, both frequentist and Bayesian, have been proposed to answer these questions.

Results: Here we present a Python package, ABC-SysBio, that implements parameter inference and model selection for dynamical systems in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. ABC-SysBio combines three algorithms: ABC rejection sampler, ABC SMC for parameter inference and ABC SMC for model selection.

	Abstract = {In this article, we present an overview of methods for sequential simulation from posterior distributions. These methods are of particular interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete time dynamic models that are typically nonlinear and non-Gaussian. A general importance sampling framework is developed that unifies many of the methods which have been proposed over the last few decades in several different scientific disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed. We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods similar to those which have previously been employed in the determin-istic filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions. Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackwellisation in order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood in dynamic models.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work is twofold. First, we survey the techniques developed in Perthame and Zubelli (Inverse Probl 23(3):1037--1052, 2007), Doumic et al. (Inverse Probl 25, 2009) to reconstruct the division (birth) rate from the cell volume distribution data in certain structured population structured population models. Secondly, we implement such techniques on experimental cell volume distributions available in the literature so as to validate the theoretical and numerical results. As a proof of concept, we use the experimental data reported in the classical work of Kubitschek (Biophys J 9(6):792--809, 1969) concerning Escherichia coli in vitro experiments measured by means of a Coulter transducer-multichannel analyzer system (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, FL, USA). Despite the rather old measurement technology, the reconstructed division rates still display potentially useful biological features.},

	Abstract = {In a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, rejection of proposed moves is an intrinsic part of ensuring that the chain converges to the intended target distribution. However, persistent rejection, perhaps in particular parts of the state space, may indicate that locally the proposal distribution is badly calibrated to the target. As an alternative to careful off-line tuning of state-dependent proposals, the basic algorithm can be modified so that, on rejection, a second attempt to move is made. A different proposal can be generated from a new distribution that is allowed to depend on the previously rejected proposal. We generalise this idea of delaying the rejection and adapting the proposal distribution, due to Tierney & Mira (1999), to generate a more flexible class of methods that applies in particular to a variable-dimension setting. The approach is illustrated by two pedagogical examples and a more realistic application to a changepoints analysis for point processes.},

	Abstract = {A proper choice of a proposal distribution for Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, for example for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, is well known to be a crucial factor for the convergence of the algorithm. In this paper we introduce an adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm, where the Gaussian proposal distribution is updated along the process using the full information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive nature of the process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we establish here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that the AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is easy to use in practical computation.},

Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

Despite representing a substantial methodological advance, existing methods based on rejection sampling or Markov chain Monte Carlo can be highly inefficient and accordingly require far more iterations than may be practical to implement. Here we propose a sequential Monte Carlo sampler that convincingly overcomes these inefficiencies. We demonstrate its implementation through an epidemiological study of the transmission rate of tuberculosis.},

However, for many complex probability models, such likelihoods are either impossible or computationally prohibitive to obtain. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for generating observations from a posterior distribution without the use of likelihoods. It can also be used in frequentist applications, in particular for maximum-likelihood estimation. The approach is illustrated by an example of ancestral inference in population genetics. A number of open problems are highlighted in the discussion.},

@article{KalitaSar2011,
	Abstract = {The canonical nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling pathway controls a gene network important in the cellular inflammatory response. Upon activation, NF-kB/RelA is released from cytoplasmic inhibitors, from where it translocates into the nucleus, subsequently activating negative feedback loops producing either monophasic or damped oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics. Although the population behavior of the NF-kB pathway has been extensively modeled, the sources of cell-to-cell variability are not well understood. We describe an integrated experimental-computational analysis of NF-kB/RelA translocation in a validated cell model exhibiting monophasic dynamics. Quantitative measures of cellular geometry and total cytoplasmic concentration and translocated RelA amounts were used as priors in Bayesian inference to estimate biophysically realistic parameter values based on dynamic live cell imaging studies of enhanced GFP-tagged RelA in stable transfectants. Bayesian inference was performed on multiple cells simultaneously, assuming identical reaction rate parameters, whereas cellular geometry and initial and total NF-kB concentration-related parameters were cell-specific. A subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct kinetic profiles was identified that corresponded to differences in the IkBalpha translation rate. We conclude that cellular geometry, initial and total NF-kB concentration, IkBalpha translation, and IkBalpha degradation rates account for distinct cell-to-cell differences in canonical NF-kB translocation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are highly heterogeneous in terms of cell size, protein expression, and signaling activity. To analyze their heterogeneity, threshold-based methods are commonly used, which often yield highly variable results due to the subjectivity of the individual investigator. In this work, we introduce a threshold-free analysis approach for sparse and highly heterogeneous datasets obtained from cultures of sensory neurons. This approach is based on population estimates and completely free of investigator-set parameters. With a quantitative automated microscope we measured the signaling state of single DRG neurons by immunofluorescently labeling phosphorylated, i.e., activated Erk1/2. The population density of sensory neurons with and without pain-sensitizing nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment was estimated using a kernel density estimator (KDE). By subtraction of both densities and integration of the positive part, a robust estimate for the size of the responsive subpopulations was obtained. To assure sufficiently large datasets, we determined the number of cells required for reliable estimates using a bootstrapping approach. The proposed methods were employed to analyze response kinetics and response amplitude of DRG neurons after NGF stimulation. We thereby determined the portion of NGF responsive cells on a true population basis. The analysis of the dose dependent NGF response unraveled a biphasic behavior, while the study of its time dependence showed a rapid response, which approached a steady state after less than five minutes. Analyzing two parameter correlations, we found that not only the number of responsive small-sized neurons exceeds the number of responsive large-sized neurons---which is commonly reported and could be explained by the excess of small-sized cells---but also the probability that small-sized cells respond to NGF is higher. In contrast, medium-sized and large-sized neurons showed a larger response amplitude in their mean Erk1/2 activity.},

	Abstract = {Microarrays first made the analysis of the transcriptome possible, and have produced much important information. Today, however, researchers are increasingly turning to direct high-throughput sequencing - RNA-Seq - which has considerable advantages for examining transcriptome fine structure - for example in the detection of allele-specific expression and splice junctions. In this article, we discuss the relative merits of the two techniques, the inherent biases in each, and whether all of the vast body of array work needs to be revisited using the newer technology. We conclude that microarrays remain useful and accurate tools for measuring expression levels, and RNA-Seq complements and extends microarray measurements.},

	Abstract = {We describe a rapid and very sensitive method for detecting proteins as antigens after their separation in polyacrylamide/agarose composite gels, with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate. The polyacrylamide matrix is crosslinked with a reagent that can be cleaved with periodate or alkali to facilitate transfer of the protein bands to diazobenzyloxymethyl-paper, where they are coupled covalently. Specific proteins are detected by autoradiography after sequential incubation with unfractionated, unlabeled specific antiserum and 125I-labeled protein A from Staphylococcus aureus. Antibody and protein A can be removed with urea and 2-mercaptoethanol, and the same paper can be probed again with a different antiserum. An antiserum specific for the simian virus 40 virion proteins VP3 and VP2 has been prepared; it does not crossreact with VP1, as demonstrated by this method. An antiserum raised in rabbits against simian virus 40-transformed rabbit kidney cells is shown to be directed primarily against a periodate-sensitive moiety present in tumor (T) antigen from infected or transformed cells, whereas an antiserum raised in rabbits against large T antigen purified from lytically infected monkey kidney cells by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate [Lane, D.P. & Robbins, A.K. (1978) Virology 87, 182-193] is directed primarily against determinants that are not sensitive to periodate.},

	Abstract = {Continuous scatterplots and parallel coordinates are used to visualize multivariate data defined on a continuous domain. With the existing techniques, rendering such plots becomes prohibitively slow, especially for large scientific datasets. This paper presents a scalable and progressive rendering algorithm for continuous data plots that allows exploratory analysis of large datasets at interactive framerates. The algorithm employs splatting to produce a series of plots that are combined using alpha blending to achieve a progressively improving image. For each individual frame, splats are obtained by transforming Gaussian density kernels from the 3-D domain of the input dataset to the respective data domain. A closed-form analytic description of the resulting splat footprints is derived to allow pre-computation of splat textures for efficient GPU rendering. The plotting method is versatile because it supports arbitrary reconstruction or interpolation schemes for the input data and the splatting technique is scalable because it chooses splat samples independently from the size of the input dataset. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is compared to existing techniques regarding rendering performance and quality.},

	Abstract = {The mitotic spindle checkpoint halts the cell cycle until all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindles. Evidence suggests that the checkpoint prevents cell-cycle progression by inhibiting the activity of the APC-Cdc20 complex, but the precise mechanism underlying this inhibition is not yet known. Here, we use mathematical modeling to compare several mechanisms that could account for this inhibition. We describe the interplay between the capacities to strongly inhibit cell-cycle progression before spindle attachment on one hand and to rapidly resume cell-cycle progression once the last kinetochore is attached on the other hand. We find that inhibition that is restricted to the kinetochore region is not sufficient for supporting both requirements when realistic diffusion constants are considered. A mechanism that amplifies the checkpoint signal through autocatalyzed inhibition is also insufficient. In contrast, amplifying the signal through the release of a diffusible inhibitory complex can support reliable checkpoint function. Our results suggest that the design of the spindle checkpoint network is limited by physical constraints imposed by realistic diffusion constants and the relevant spatial and temporal dimensions where computation is performed.},

@article{Turing1952,
	Abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically, unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is faund that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

	Abstract = {We define a linear physiologically structured population model by two rules, one for reproduction and one for ``movement'' and survival. We use these ingredients to give a constructive definition of next-population-state operators. For the autonomous case we define the basic reproduction ratio R 0 and the Malthusian parameter r and we compute the resolvent in terms of the Laplace transform of the ingredients. A key feature of our approach is that unbounded operators are avoided throughout. This will facilitate the treatment of nonlinear models as a next step.},

Using the finite element method to solve the Fokker-Planck equation we have studied (i) the impact of noise on the regularity of the oscillations quantified as the coefficient of variation, (ii) stochastic synchronization of two uncoupled phase oscillators driven by correlated noise, and (iii) their cross-correlation function. We show that, in general, the limit of type II oscillators is more robust to noise and more efficient at synchronizing by correlated noise than type I.},

	Abstract = {n the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the differential equation that describes the time evolution of the lower-order statistical moments for the number of molecules of the different species involved, is generally not closed, in the sense that the right-hand side of this equation depends on higher-order moments. Recent work has proposed a moment closure technique based on derivative-matching, which closes the moment equations by approximating higher-order moments as nonlinear functions of lower-order moments. We here provide a mathematical proof of this moment closure technique, and highlight its performance through comparisons with alternative methods. These comparisons reveal that this moment closure technique based on derivative-matching provides more accurate estimates of the moment dynamics, especially when the population size is small. Finally, we show that the accuracy of the proposed moment closure scheme can be arbitrarily increased by incurring additional computational effort.},

	Abstract = {The author describes a model for Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHSs) where transitions between discrete modes are triggered by stochastic events. The rate at which these transitions occur is allowed to depend both on the continuous and the discrete states of the SHS. Several examples of SHSs arising from a varied pool of application areas are discussed. These include modeling of the Transmission Control Protocol's (TCP) algorithm for congestion control both for long-lived and on-off flows; state-estimation for networked control systems; and the stochastic modeling of chemical reactions. These examples illustrate the use of SHSs as a modeling tool.

Attention is mostly focused on polynomial stochastic hybrid systems (pSHSs) that generally correspond to stochastic hybrid systems with polynomial continuous vector fields, reset maps, and transition intensities. For pSHSs, the dynamics of the statistical moments of the continuous states evolve according to infinite-dimensional linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We show that these ODEs can be approximated by finite-dimensional nonlinear ODEs with arbitrary precision. Based on this result, a procedure to build this type of approximations for certain classes of pSHSs is provided. This procedure is applied to several examples and the accuracy of the results obtained is evaluated through comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations.},

	Abstract = {In stochastic models of chemically reacting systems that contain bimolecular reactions, the dynamics of the moments of order up to n of the species populations do not form a closed system, in the sense that their time-derivatives depend on moments of order n + 1. To close the dynamics, the moments of order n + 1 are generally approximated by nonlinear functions of the lower order moments. If the molecule counts of some of the species have a high probability of becoming zero, such approximations may lead to imprecise results and stochastic simulation is the only viable alternative for system analysis. Stochastic simulation can produce exact realizations of chemically reacting systems, but tends to become computationally expensive, especially for stiff systems that involve reactions at different time scales. Further, in some systems, important stochastic events can be very rare and many simulations are necessary to obtain accurate estimates. The computational cost of stochastic simulation can then be prohibitively large. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating the moments of chemically reacting systems. The method is based on closing the moment dynamics by replacing the moments of order n + 1 by estimates calculated from a small number of stochastic simulation runs. The resulting stochastic system is then used in an extended Kalman filter, where estimates of the moments of order up to n, obtained from the same simulation, serve as outputs of the system. While the initial motivation for the method was improving over the performance of stochastic simulation and moment closure methods, we also demonstrate that it can be used in an experimental setting to estimate moments of species that cannot be measured directly from time course measurements of the moments of other species.},

	Abstract = {Synthetic biology has recently provided functional single-cell oscillators. With a few exceptions, however, synchronization across a population has not been achieved yet. In particular, designing a cell coupling mechanism to achieve autonomous synchronization is not straightforward since there are usually several different design alternatives. Here, we propose a method to mathematically predict autonomous synchronization properties, and to identify the network structure with the best performance, thus increasing the feasibility for a successful implementation in vivo.Our method relies on the reduction of ODE-based models for synthetic oscillators to a phase description, and the subsequent analysis of the phase model either in the spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous case. This analysis identifies three major factors determining if and when autonomous synchronization can be achieved, namely cell density, cell to cell variability, and structural design decisions. Moreover, when considering a spatially heterogeneous medium, we observe phase waves. These waves may hinder synchronization substantially, and their suppression should be considered in the design process.In contrast to previous work, we analyze the synchronization process of models of experimentally validated synthetic oscillators in mammalian cells. Alternative designs for cell-to-cell communication via a quorum sensing mechanism differ in few mechanistic details, but these differences have important implications for autonomous synchronization. Our analysis suggests that not only the periodical transcription of the protein producing the signaling molecule, but also of the receptor protein is necessary to achieve good performance.},

@article{LipniackiPas2004,
	Abstract = {The two-feedback-loop regulatory module of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling pathway is modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. The constructed model involves two-compartment kinetics of the activators IkB (IKK) and NF-kB; the inhibitors A20 and IkBa; and their complexes. In resting cells, the unphosphorylated IkBa binds to NF-kB and sequesters it in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. In response to extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1, IKK is transformed from its neutral form (IKKn) into its active form (IKKa), a form capable of phosphorylating IkBa; leading to IkBa degradation. Degradation of IkBa releases the main activator NF-kB; which then enters the nucleus and triggers transcription of the inhibitors and numerous other genes. The newly synthesized IkBa leads NF-kB out of the nucleus and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, while A20 inhibits IKK converting IKKa into the inactive form (IKKi), a form different from IKKn, no longer capable of phosphorylating IkBa: After parameter fitting, the proposed model is able to properly reproduce time behavior of all variables for which the data are available: NF-kB; cytoplasmic IkBa; A20 and IkBa mRNA transcripts, IKK and IKK catalytic activity in both wild-type and A20-deficient cells. The model allows detailed analysis of kinetics of the involved proteins and their complexes and gives the predictions of the possible responses of whole kinetics to the change in the level of a given activator or inhibitor.

Here, we analysed how signalling pathways can still process information quantitatively despite strong heterogeneity in protein levels. We systematically perturbed the protein levels of Erk, the terminal kinase in the MAPK signalling pathway in a panel of human cell lines. We found that the steady-state phosphorylation of Erk is very robust against perturbations of Erk protein level. Although a multitude of mechanisms exist that may provide robustness against fluctuating protein levels, we found that one single feedback from Erk to Raf-1 accounts for the observed robustness. Surprisingly, robustness is provided through a fast post-translational mechanism although variation of Erk levels occurs on a timescale of days.},

Based on time-series data of a process we estimate the kinetic rate constants by maximizing the likelihood of the data. The computation of the likelihood relies on a dynamic abstraction of the discrete state space of the Markov model which successfully mitigates the problem of state space largeness. We compare two variants of our method to state-of-the-art, recently published methods and demonstrate their usefulness and efficiency on several case studies from systems biology},

@article{JiaSte2011,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Time-series measurements of metabolite concentration have become increasingly more common, providing data for building kinetic models of metabolic networks using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In practice, however, such time-course data are usually incomplete and noisy, and the estimation of kinetic parameters from these data is challenging. Practical limitations due to data and computational aspects, such as solving stiff ODEs and finding global optimal solution to the estimation problem, give motivations to develop a new estimation procedure that can circumvent some of these constraints.

Results: In this work, an incremental and iterative parameter estimation method is proposed that combines and iterates between two estimation phases. One phase involves a decoupling method, in which a subset of model parameters that are associated with measured metabolites, are estimated using the minimization of slope errors. Another phase follows, in which the ODE model is solved one equation at a time and the remaining model parameters are obtained by minimizing concentration errors. The performance of this two-phase method was tested on a generic branched metabolic pathway and the glycolytic pathway of Lactococcus lactis. The results showed that the method is efficient in getting accurate parameter estimates, even when some information is missing.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the topic of model reduction for nonlinear dynamical systems based on kernel expansions. Our approach allows for a full offline/online decomposition and efficient online computation of the reduced model. In particular, we derive an a-posteriori state-space error estimator for the reduction error. A key ingredient is a local Lipschitz constant estimation that enables rigorous a-posteriori error estimation. The computation of the error estimator is realized by solving an auxiliary differential equation during online simulations. Estimation iterations can be performed that allow a balancing between estimation sharpness and computation time. Numerical experiments demonstrate the estimation improvement over different estimator versions and the rigor and effectiveness of the error bounds.},

	Abstract = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene-regulatory and biochemical networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize, model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. in addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other Systems Biology Workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

	Abstract = {The NF-kB signaling system is involved in a variety of cellular processes including immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. Recent experiments have found oscillations in the nuclearcytoplasmic translocation of the NF-kB transcription factor [Hoffmann, A., et al. (2002) Science 298, 1241--1245; Nelson, D. E., et al. (2004) Science 306, 704--708.] How the cell uses the oscillations to differentiate input conditions and send specific signals to downstream genes is an open problem. We shed light on this issue by examining the small core network driving the oscillations, which we show is designed to produce periodic spikes in nuclear NF-B concentration. The presence of oscillations is extremely robust to variation of parameters, depending mainly on the saturation of the active degradation rate of IkB, an inhibitor of NF-kB. The oscillations can be used to regulate downstream genes in a variety of ways. In particular, we show that genes to whose operator sites NF-kB binds and dissociates fast can respond very sensitively to changes in the input signal, with effective Hill coefficients of >20.},

@article{Ochab-MarcinekTab2010,
	Abstract = {Bimodality of gene expression, as a mechanism contributing to phenotypic diversity, enhances the survival of cells in a fluctuating environment. To date, the bimodal response of a gene regulatory system has been attributed to the cooperativity of transcription factor binding or to feedback loops. It has remained unclear whether noncooperative binding of transcription factors can give rise to bimodality in an open-loop system. We study a theoretical model of gene expression in a two-step cascade (a deterministically monostable system) in which the regulatory gene produces transcription factors that have a nonlinear effect on the activity of the target gene. We show that a unimodal distribution of transcription factors over the cell population can generate a bimodal steady-state output without cooperative transcription factor binding. We introduce a simple method of geometric construction that allows one to predict the onset of bimodality. The construction only involves the parameters of bursting of the regulatory gene and the dose-response curve of the target gene. Using this method, we show that the gene expression may switch between unimodal and bimodal as the concentration of inducers or corepressors is varied. These findings may explain the experimentally observed bimodal response of cascades consisting of a fluorescent protein reporter controlled by the tetracycline repressor. The geometric construction provides a useful tool for designing experiments and for interpretation of their results. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the strategies adopted by cell populations to survive in changing environments.},

	Abstract = {The long-term fluctuation of transmission loss in scatter propagation systems has been found to have a logarithmicnormal distribution. In other words, the scatter loss in decibels has Gaussian statistical distribution. Therefore, in many important communication systems (e.g., FM), the noise power of a radio jump, or hop, has log-normal statistical distribution. In a multihop system, the noise power of each hop contributes to the total noise. The resulting noise of the system is therefore the statistical sum of the individual noise distributions. In multihop scatter systems and others, such as multichannel speech-transmission systems, the sum of several log-normal distributions is needed. No exact solution to this problem is known. The following discussion presents an approximate solution which is satisfactory in most practical cases. For tactical multihop scatter systems, a further approximation is proposed, which reduces significantly the necessary computation. An example of the computation is given.},

	Abstract = {Cells remove proteins by two processes: degradation and dilution due to cell growth. The balance between these basic processes is poorly understood. We addressed this by developing an accurate and noninvasive method for measuring protein half-lives, called "bleach-chase," that is applicable to fluorescently tagged proteins. Assaying 100 proteins in living human cancer cells showed half-lives that ranged between 45 minutes and 22.5 hours. A variety of stresses that stop cell division showed the same general effect: Long-lived proteins became longer-lived, whereas short-lived proteins remained largely unaffected. This effect is due to the relative strengths of degradation and dilution and suggests a mechanism for differential killing of rapidly growing cells by growth-arresting drugs. This approach opens a way to understand proteome half-life dynamics in living cells.},

In contrast, understanding of the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating nociceptor sensitization downstream of ligand binding to the receptors is still at a relatively nascent stage. After outlining the initiated signaling cascades, we discuss the emerging plasticity within these cascades and the importance of subcellular compartmentalization. In addition, the recently realized importance of functional interactions with the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, intracellular organelles such as mitochondria, and sex hormones will be introduced. This burgeoning literature establishes new cellular features crucial for the function of nociceptive neurons and argues that additional focus should be placed on understanding the complex integration of cellular events that make up the "cell biology of pain."},

	Abstract = {The sensation of pain alerts us to real or impending injury and triggers appropriate protective responses. Unfortunately, pain often outlives its usefulness as a warning system and instead becomes chronic and debilitating. This transition to a chronic phase involves changes within the spinal cord and brain, but there is also remarkable modulation where pain messages are initiated - at the level of the primary sensory neuron. Efforts to determine how these neurons detect pain-producing stimuli of a thermal, mechanical or chemical nature have revealed new signalling mechanisms and brought us closer to understanding the molecular events that facilitate transitions from acute to persistent pain.},

@article{HuchoDin2005,
	Abstract = {The epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCepsilon) has emerged as a critical second messenger in sensitization toward mechanical stimulation in models of neuropathic (diabetes, alcoholism, and cancer therapy) as well as acute and chronic inflammatory pain. Signaling pathways leading to activation of PKCepsilon remain unknown. Recent results indicate signaling from cAMP to PKC. A mechanism connecting cAMP and PKC, two ubiquitous, commonly considered separate pathways, remains elusive. We found that, in cultured DRG neurons, signaling from cAMP to PKCepsilon is not mediated by PKA but by the recently identified cAMP-activated guanine exchange factor Epac. Epac, in turn, was upstream of phospholipase C (PLC) and PLD, both of which were necessary for translocation and activation of PKCepsilon. This signaling pathway was specific to isolectin B4-positive [IB4(+)] nociceptors. Also, in a behavioral model, cAMP produced mechanical hyperalgesia (tenderness) through Epac, PLC/PLD, and PKCepsilon. By delineating this signaling pathway, we provide a mechanism for cAMP-to-PKC signaling, give proof of principle that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway-activating protein Epac also stimulates PKC, describe the first physiological function unique for the IB4(+) subpopulation of sensory neurons, and find proof of principle that G-protein-coupled receptors can activate PKC not only through the G-proteins alpha(q) and betagamma but also through alpha(s).},

@article{BelmonteVia2008,
	Abstract = {Animals detect environmental changes through sensory neural mechanisms that enable them to differentiate the quality, intensity and temporal characteristics of stimuli. The 'doctrine of specific nervous energies' postulates that the different sensory modalities experienced by humans result of the activation of specific nervous pathways. Identification of functional classes of sensory receptors provided scientific support to the concept that somatosensory modalities (touch, pain, temperature, kinesthesis) are subserved by separate populations of sensory receptor neurons specialized in detecting innocuous and injurious stimuli of different quality (mechanical forces, temperature, chemical compounds). The identification of receptor proteins activated by different physicochemical stimuli, in particular ion channels of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) superfamily, has put forward the concept that specificity of peripheral sensory receptor neurons is determined by their expression of a particular "molecular sensor" that confers to each functional type its selectivity to respond with a discharge of nerve impulses to stimuli of a given quality. Nonetheless, recent experimental data suggest that the various molecular sensors proposed as specific transducer molecules for stimuli of different quality are not as neatly associated with the distinct functional types of sensory receptors as originally proposed. First, many ion channel molecules initially associated to the transduction of only one particular form of energy are also activated by stimuli of different quality, implying a limited degree of specificity in their transducing capacities. Second, molecular sensors associated with a stimulus quality and hence to a sensory receptor type and ultimately to a sensory modality may be concomitantly expressed in sensory receptor neurons functionally defined as specific for another stimulus quality. Finally, activation of voltage gated channels involved primarily in nerve impulse generation can also influence the gating of transducing channels, dramatically modifying their activation profile. Thus, we propose that the capacity exhibited by the different functional types of somatosensory receptor neurons to preferentially detect and encode specific stimuli into a discharge of nerve impulses, appears to result of a characteristic combinatorial expression of different ion channels in each neuronal type that finally determines their transduction and impulse firing properties. Transduction channels don't operate in isolation and their cellular context should also be taken into consideration to fully understand their function. Moreover, the inhomogeneous distribution of transduction and voltage-gated channels at soma, axonal branches and peripheral endings of primary sensory neurons influences the characteristics of the propagated impulse discharge that encodes the properties of the stimulus. Alteration of this concerted operation of ion channels in pathological conditions may underlie the changes in excitability accompanying peripheral sensory neuron injuries.},

When intense, these stimuli generate acute pain, and in the setting of persistent injury, both peripheral and central nervous system components of the pain transmission pathway exhibit tremendous plasticity, enhancing pain signals and producing hypersensitivity. When plasticity facilitates protective reflexes, it can be beneficial, but when the changes persist, a chronic pain condition may result. Genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological studies are elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie detection, coding, and modulation of noxious stimuli that generate pain.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression involves inherently probabilistic steps that create fluctuations in protein abundances. The results from many in-depth analyses and genome-scale surveys have suggested how such fluctuations arise and spread, often in ways consistent with stochastic models of transcription and translation. But fluctuations also arise during cell division when molecules are partitioned stochastically between the two daughters. Here we mathematically demonstrate how stochastic partitioning contributes to the non-genetic heterogeneity. Our results show that partitioning errors are hard to correct, and that the resulting noise profiles are remarkably difficult to separate from gene expression noise. By applying these results to common experimental strategies and distinguishing between creation versus transmission of noise, we hypothesize that much of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that has been attributed to various aspects of gene expression instead comes from random segregation at cell division. We propose experiments to separate between these two types of fluctuations and discuss future directions.},

	Abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the source for the lifelong supply of functional cells in peripheral blood while they simultaneously maintain their own reserve pool. However, there is accumulating evidence that HSCs are themselves subject to quantitative and qualitative exhaustion. Although several processes linked to mitotic activity can potentially account for the observed aging phenomena (e.g., DNA damage, telomere shortening, epigenetic modification), a precise understanding of HSC exhaustion is still missing. It is particularly unclear how individual aging processes on the single-cell level translate on the phenotypic level of the overall tissue and whether there is a functional implication of an age-structured HSC population. We address these issues by applying a novel mathematical model of HSC organization in which division-specific, cumulative alterations of stem cell quality determine the phenotypic and functional appearance of the overall cell population. Adapting the model to a number of basic experimental findings, we quantify the level of additional heterogeneity that is introduced by a population of individually aging cells. Based on this model, weare able to conclude that division-dependent processes of cellular aging explain a wide range of phenomena on HSC exhaustion and that HSC aging needs to be considered as a highly heterogeneous process. We furthermore report that functional heterogeneity between young and old HSCs appears closely similar to the phenomena described for long- and short-term repopulating cells. We speculate whether differential, division-coupled stem cell aging introduces an intra-animal variability that also accounts for heterogeneity with respect to the repopulation ability of HSCs.},

	Abstract = {Background: Apart from the work of Lampariello and colleagues (Cytometry 15:294--301, 1994; Cytometry 32: 241--254, 1998), very little analytical work has been carried out for analysis of immunofluorescence distributions containing an overlapping mixture of labeled and unlabeled cells. The methods developed tend to rely on fitting theoretical distributions to the relevant populations. However, the method described here attempts to produce an analytical solution.

Methods: A new method for immunofluorescence histogram analysis is presented. It uses cumulative frequency distribution subtraction of the test sample from the control to predict the mean of a labeled cell component embedded within a histogram containing unlabeled cells. Ratio analysis of means (RAM) was then carried out to calculate the labeled fraction. The results were submitted to Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis and Student's t-test for validation at a given level of probability.

Results: The method was developed with a data set exhibiting a small ``positive'' shoulder, which was predicted to contain a labeled fraction comprising 8.0% of the total at the 99% confidence limit. It was then tested with data analyzed and published previously where the Johnson Su family of distributions was used in curve fitting. Conclusions: There was good agreement between the known and predicted proportions of labeled cells. However, the method is dependent on the symmetry of the distributions. Some minor systematic errors were encountered due, in part, to skewed experimental distributions.},

	Abstract = {In a recent paper (Lampariello: Cytometry 15:294- 301, 1994), we proposed a method for the automated evaluation of the percentage of positive cells from flow cytometric immunofluorescence histograms. The method is based on a suitable mathematical representation of the control histogram, which is used to identify the negative cell distribution in the test histogram. In this paper we present an improvement of the previous method, where we assume that the positive cell distribution in the test can also be modeled making use of an empirical distribution of the same kind as employed for modeling the control. The parameters of this distribution are estimated directly from the test. In this way, a mathematical representation of the whole test distribution is calculated without having to set up a purely positive control.

In order to evaluate the accuracy of the method in the determination of the positive percentage, we carried out a set of measurements of double-labeled and suitably treated cells, mixed in different ratios with control cells, and from each sample we obtained histograms with overlapped and well-separated positive and negative distributions. These last histograms allow us to determine the actual positive percentages and thus to evaluate the performance of the analysis method applied to the histograms with overlapped distributions.},

	Abstract = {A number of methods have previously been considered for the statistical comparison of flow cytometric frequency distributions. For two distributions, the foremost of these is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, which has been criticized as ''too sensitive.'' We discuss some alternative methods based on the Poisson distribution. The assumption of Poisson variation within channels allows the use of channel-by-channel confidence intervals and chi-square tests. These are simple and more appropriate for discrete data than the K-S test. Graphical displays of these and other techniques are presented. We also attempt to set the problem in an appropriate context. We argue that any statistical procedure must rest on a reasonable understanding of the nature of the variability in the system. This understanding takes the form of an appropriate probability model, which may be approximate but must provide a reasonably accurate description of the data. Incomplete Understanding of the data can lead to inappropriate analysis. We discuss the assumptions that underlie our techniques and consider extensions to more complex situations.},

	Abstract = {Background: The problem considered is the quantitative comparison of immunofluorescence frequency distributions in order to detect their differences of biological significance, i.e., to evaluate the potential positivity of a cell sample with respect to negative control cells. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test, proposed in the literature for this purpose, is examined and discussed through its application to a set of experimental measurements. It is shown that even differences due to the stain procedure or to instrumental biases may be considered significant by the test implemented in the standard form.

Methods: In order to ensure valid results, it is necessary to take into account the various sources of variation in the specific experimental context. A procedure is proposed that uses the KS statistics as a reference for determining an appropriate estimate of the overall variability in the control data. This estimate is derived from the comparisons of the cumulative distributions associated with repeated measurements of the negative cell sample.

Results and Conclusions: The KS-related index thus defined provides a tool for assessing the potential positivity of a cell sample, since it allows to distinguish between statistical and biological significance of the difference between the histogram to be tested and the set of control data. In particular, if a cell sample is not included in the control variability, either a positive cell subpopulation is present, or all cells are positive. Instead, for a sample included in the control variability, the difference will be not biologically meaningful, even if statistically significant. Moreover, when a purely positive control sample is also available, it is possible to derive a measure of the precision at which a true biological positivity can be detected. Finally, since the index is not absolute, but relative to the features of the instrumentation, of the antibodies and of the fluorochromes used, it represents a quantitative measure of the stability and reproducibility of the measurement process and could be used for quality control of flow cytometric experiments in immunofluorescence.},

	Abstract = {The stochastic dynamical behavior of a well-stirred mixture of N molecular species that chemically interact through M reaction channels is accurately described by the chemical master equation. It is shown here that, whenever two explicit dynamical conditions are satisfied, the microphysical premise from which the chemical master equation is derived leads directly to an approximate time-evolution equation of the Langevin type. This chemical Langevin equation is the same as one studied earlier by Kurtz, in contradistinction to some other earlier proposed forms that assume a deterministic macroscopic evolution law. The novel aspect of the present analysis is that it shows that the accuracy of the equation depends on the satisfaction of certain specific conditions that can change from moment to moment, rather than on a static system size parameter. The derivation affords a new perspective on the origin and magnitude of noise in a chemically reacting system. It also clarifies the connection between the stochastically correct chemical master equation, and the deterministic but often satisfactory reaction rate equation.},

A general expression is derived under the sole assumption that each protein molecule has equal probability of joining either daughter cell at cell division, i.e. a binomial partitioning. With reasonable assumptions about transcription and translation probabilities a specific protein distribution is described. The main result is that this distribution is very broad, especially for small protein numbers; it is definitely not a Poisson distribution. The case of repressor proteins, which have one strong binding site on the chromosome, is treated separately. As a specific example, the distribution of /I-galactosidase is described, also in regard to the influence from the statistical fluctuations in the distribution of the fat repressors.},

	Abstract = {High content imaging (HCI) is an increasingly important method for elucidating changes in cellular biology. The combination of validated immuno-fluorescent assays, availability of automated microscopy, and advances in image analysis software has led to increased exploitation of this technology in a variety of settings ranging from cellular signaling pathways to drug discovery. Recent advances in HCI have made the collection of multi-parametric datasets from high-throughput screening routine, but analysis of these data remains a challenge. The few existing analytical tools used to analyze HCI data, usually provided by HCI platform vendors, require extensive operator interaction and, more importantly, lack statistical power. This results in serious under-utilization of the information available from this powerful technology. As HCI applications become increasingly complex, measurements to estimate the composition of the cell population and thus the underlying data structure also becomes more complicated, and the analysis to facilitate the understanding of the biological system will rely heavily on analytical expertise that requires advanced statistical training. The aim of this article is to review the major statistical issues in HCI data analysis, with a focus on quantitative analysis of cell subpopulations.},

	Abstract = {Recent interest in modeling biochemical networks raises questions about the relationship between often complex mathematical models and familiar arithmetic concepts from classical enzymology, and also about connections between modeling and experimental data. This review addresses both topics by familiarizing readers with key concepts (and terminology) in the construction, validation, and application of deterministic biochemical models, with particular emphasis on a simple enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Networks of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are the natural language for describing enzyme kinetics in a mass action approximation. We illustrate this point by showing how the familiar Briggs-Haldane formulation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics derives from the outer (or quasi-steady-state) solution of a dynamical system of ODEs describing a simple reaction under special conditions. We discuss how parameters in the Michaelis-Menten approximation and in the underlying ODE network can be estimated from experimental data, with a special emphasis on the origins of uncertainty. Finally, we extrapolate from a simple reaction to complex models of multiprotein biochemical networks. The concepts described in this review, hitherto of interest primarily to practitioners, are likely to become important for a much broader community of cellular and molecular biologists attempting to understand the promise and challenges of "systems biology" as applied to biochemical mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Variability in patient responses to even the most potent and targeted therapeutics is now the primary challenge facing drug discovery and patient care, particularly in oncology and immune therapy. Variability with respect to mechanisms of induced resistance is observed both in drug-naive patients and among those who are initially responsive. Genomics has developed powerful tools for systematic interrogation of disease genotype and transcriptional states (particularly in cancer) and for correlation of these measures with parameters of disease such as histological diagnosis and outcome. In contrast, mechanistic preclinical studies remain relatively narrowly focused, leading to many apparent contradictions and poor understanding of the determinants of response. We describe the emergence of a systems pharmacology approach that is mechanistic, quantitative, probabilistic, and postgenomic and promises to do for mechanistic pharmacology what genomics is doing for correlative studies. We focus on studies in cell lines (which currently dominate mechanism-oriented analysis), but our arguments are equally valid for real tumors studied in short-term culture as xenografts and, perhaps some time in the future, in humans.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical description of biological processes such as gene regulatory networks or signalling pathways by dynamic models utilising ordinary differential equations faces challenges if the model parameters like rate constants are estimated from incomplete and noisy experimental data. Typically, biological networks are only partially observed. Only a fraction of the modelled molecular species is measurable directly. This can result in structurally non-identifiable model parameters. Furthermore, practical non-identifiability can arise from limited amount and quality of experimental data. In the challenge of growing model complexity on one side, and experimental limitations on the other side, both types of non-identifiability arise frequently in systems biological applications often prohibiting reliable prediction of system dynamics. On theoretical grounds this article summarises how and why both types of non-identifiability arise. It exemplifies pitfalls where models do not yield reliable predictions of system dynamics because of non-identifiabilities. Subsequently, several approaches for identifiability analysis proposed in the literature are discussed. The aim is to provide an overview of applicable methods for detecting parameter identifiability issues. Once non-identifiability is detected, it can be resolved either by experimental design, measuring additional data under suitable conditions; or by model reduction, tailoring the size of the model to the information content provided by the experimental data. Both strategies enhance model predictability and will be elucidated by an example application. [Includes supplementary material].},

	Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease that profoundly affects energy homeostasis. The disease involves failure at several levels and subsystems and is characterized by insulin resistance in target cells and tissues (i.e. by impaired intracellular insulin signaling). We have previously used an iterative experimental-theoretical approach to unravel the early insulin signaling events in primary human adipocytes. That study, like most insulin signaling studies, is based on in vitro experimental examination of cells, and the in vivo relevance of such studies for human beings has not been systematically examined. Herein, we develop a hierarchical model of the adipose tissue, which links intracellular insulin control of glucose transport in human primary adipocytes with whole-body glucose homeostasis. An iterative approach between experiments and minimal modeling allowed us to conclude that it is not possible to scale up the experimentally determined glucose uptake by the isolated adipocytes to match the glucose uptake profile of the adipose tissue in vivo. However, a model that additionally includes insulin effects on blood flow in the adipose tissue and GLUT4 translocation due to cell handling can explain all data, but neither of these additions is sufficient independently. We also extend the minimal model to include hierarchical dynamic links to more detailed models (both to our own models and to those by others), which act as submodules that can be turned on or off. The resulting multilevel hierarchical model can merge detailed results on different subsystems into a coherent understanding of whole-body glucose homeostasis. This hierarchical modeling can potentially create bridges between other experimental model systems and the in vivo human situation and offers a framework for systematic evaluation of the physiological relevance of in vitro obtained molecular/cellular experimental data.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel and simple method to numerically calculate Fisher information matrices for stochastic chemical kinetics models. The linear noise approximation is used to derive model equations and a likelihood function that leads to an efficient computational algorithm. Our approach reduces the problem of calculating the Fisher information matrix to solving a set of ordinary differential equations. This is the first method to compute Fisher information for stochastic chemical kinetics models without the need for Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology is then used to study sensitivity, robustness, and parameter identifiability in stochastic chemical kinetics models. We show that significant differences exist between stochastic and deterministic models as well as between stochastic models with time-series and time-point measurements. We demonstrate that these discrepancies arise from the variability in molecule numbers, correlations between species, and temporal correlations and show how this approach can be used in the analysis and design of experiments probing stochastic processes at the cellular level. The algorithm has been implemented as a Matlab package and is available from the authors upon request.},

	Abstract = {Background: The treatment of cancer with therapeutics is a multi-scale problem, involving: (i) the distribution processes in the vascular system, the capillary bed and the tissue; and (ii) the initiation of intracellular signaling resulting in cell fate decisions. This fact has been appreciated for years but the development of mechanistic models spanning all these scales just begins. In particular, heterogeneity among cancer cells is a fact which is not considered in most models.  

Results: In this work a preliminary mathematical model for TRAIL-fusion protein treatment of lung carcinoma is developed. The multi-scale model we propose incorporates a mechanistic description of the distribution processes (i) and of the cell signaling (ii). The former takes the particular structure and topology of lung tissue into count, while the latter one respects heterogeneity of cancer cell populations.
Mathematically the overall system is described via two partial differential equation models coupled to a cell ensemble model. Both models are implemented in individual software packages, DuMuX respectively the Matlab Toolbox CellPoT, which are linked via a newly developed interface. This allows for a maximal degree of freedom and an independent improvement of the submodels.
To gain a deeper insight into the dynamics of the treatment process, several simulation studies are performed, allowing for the assessment of the relative importance of different unknown process parameters. Especially, the time scales of the individual processes and the improved effects of a TRAIL-fusion protein compared to normal TRAIL is analyzed. 

Conclusions: Advanced modeling methods and measurement data available for different process scales enabled the development of a mechanistic, partially validated multi-scale model of TRAIL treatment of lung carcinoma. This provides deeper insight into the effects of the treatment as well as the uncertainties of the prediction. Furthermore, it helps to select the most informative future experiments, which is particular complex in a multi-scale setting.},

	Abstract = {Background: Individual cells within a clonal population often show different responses upon a common stimulus. This is a fact widely appreciated but still difficult to study using model-based approaches. The study of population heterogeneity requires the development of population models, and knowledge about cell-to-cell variability. Unfortunately, so far no suitable methods are available to systematically infer information about cellular heterogeneity from common cell-biological measurement data.

Results: In this work cell population models are studied in which the dynamics of individual cells are described by a parametric differential equation [1,2]. Cell-to-cell variability is modeled by differences in parameter values of individual cells. These parameters are subject to a probability distribution, encoding the heterogeneity. This modeling framework allows the consideration of (epi-)genetic differences, and differences in cell states [1,2].
For this model class we present a Bayesian framework for estimating population heterogeneity from measurement data [1]. This framework allows the computation of the optimal parameter distribution via convex optimization. Uncertainty of the estimate is assessed using confidence intervals which are determined via an efficient Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm.
To evaluate the approach a model of the TNF signaling pathway is analyzed. Artificial data are generated and the cell-to-cell variability is reconstructed.

Conclusions: The introduced framework offers the possibility of computationally efficiently assessment of the model uncertainties. Thus, it enables the evaluation of the predictive power of a model and hence the validity of the drawn conclusions. Furthermore, the study of the TNF signaling pathway illustrates the superiority of Bayesian methods and exemplifies the role of the usage of prior information, and the information content of flow cytometry data for studying population heterogeneity.

	Abstract = {P. B. M. Walker (1954) and H. C. Longuet-Higgins (quoted by Walker), as well as O. Scherbaum and G. Rasch (1957), made the first attempts towards a mathematical study of the age distribution in a cellular population. It was H. Von Foerster (1959), however, who derived the complete differential equation for the age density function, n(t, a). His equation is obtained from an analysis of the inBnitesimal changes occurring during a time element dt in a group of cells with ages between a and a + da. The behavior of the population is determined by a quantity A which we call the loss function. In this paper a rigorous discussion of the Von Foerster equation is presen l, and a solution is given for the special case when A depends on t (time) and a (age) but not on other variables (such as n itself). It is also shown that the age density, n(t, a), is completely known only if the birth rate, a(t), and the initial age distribution, (a), are given as boundary conditions. In Section 1I the steady state solution and some plausible forms of intrinsic loss functions (depending on a only) are discussed in view of later applications.},

@article{Levin1976,
	Abstract = {The title of this review implies certain biases which I would like to confront at the outset, suggesting in the process the alternative title "Population Dynamics and Heterogeneous Environments." Although the principal focus is on models, the emphasis is on their role in the understanding of ecological questions and not on their intrinsic mathematical beauty. Further, it would prejudice the inquiry to regard environmental heterogeneity as a property of an independent background against which the ecological drama unfolds; in many situations, biological interactions initiate or exaggerate heterogeneity.
The scope is necessarily limited. Because of the simultaneous construction of closely related reviews in this volume, it is difficult to avoid overlap with the other entries; indeed, some degree of overlap may be desirable in order to facilitate transitions between articles. However, I avoid detailed discussion of the response of the individual or the population to patchy environments; these topics are covered in the reviews by Wiens (168) and Giesel (40). Similarly, models of the dynamics of the genetics of populations in heterogeneous environments are not discussed here; there is a vast literature on this topic (3, 12, 16, 26, 33-36, 38, 47-49, 51, 55, 65, 66, 70, 71, 79, 92, 94, 95, 97a, 102a, 139, 142, 144), sufficient certainly for a separate review. Finally, the mathematical details are kept to a minimum; for those details which are omitted, the reader is referred to (82), which is the mathematical complement to this review. In a few places, the considerations are so congruent that I have seen fit to borrow sections verbatim from (82).},

	Abstract = {We introduce a novel dynamic model of stem cell and tissue organisation in murine intestinal crypts. Integrating the molecular, cellular and tissue level of description, this model links a broad spectrum of experimental observations encompassing spatially confined cell proliferation, directed cell migration, multiple cell lineage decisions and clonal competition. Using computational simulations we demonstrate that the model is capable of quantitatively describing and predicting the dynamic behaviour of the intestinal tissue during steady state as well as after cell damage and following selective gain or loss of gene function manipulations affecting Wnt- and Notch-signalling. Our simulation results suggest that reversibility and flexibility of cellular decisions are key elements of robust tissue organisation of the intestine. We predict that the tissue should be able to fully recover after complete elimination of cellular subpopulations including subpopulations deemed to be functional stem cells. This challenges current views of tissue stem cell organisation.},

The volume is divided into six easy to follow sections. The first is Apoptosis and Alternative Modes of Cell Death, followed by chapters on Telomeres and Telomerase, Senescence, Genomic Instability and Tumorigenesis. The third part covers DNA Damage Response, Signaling Pathways and Tumorigenesis, while the fourth delves into Resistance and Sensitization. The book concludes with Established Cancer Therapies and a section which looks toward the future with Recent and Developing Cancer Therapies.

In total, this volume provides basic scientists and clinicians with a deeper and more complete understanding of the cellular responses of malignancies which may determine the effectiveness of treatment, both in the initial stages of the disease as well as in disease recurrence.},

	Abstract = {The transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel expressed in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. To quantitatively determine TRPV1 protein levels in native rat tissues, novel monoclonal antibodies were raised against full-length recombinant human TRPV1 protein and utilized to develop a sandwich ELISA assay. Monoclonal antibody 10E3-1A2 specifically recognized TRPV1 protein and the recognition epitope was determined to reside in amino acids 45-58 of human and rat TRPV1. Using the TRPV1 polyclonal antibody ABRK4 as the capturing antibody and the monoclonal antibody 10E3-1A2 as the detection antibody, a sandwich ELISA that detected both human and rat TRPV1 protein was established. Recombinant human TRPV1 heterologously expressed in mammalian HEK293-F cells, which showed high ligand-binding affinity, was purified by TRPV1 monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography and used as protein standard to quantify TRPV1 protein levels. This ELISA detected TRPV1 protein as low as 1.5 ng/ml (15 pM), and was able to determine TRPV1 protein levels in native rat tissues such as DRG and spinal cord. This is the first TRPV1 sandwich ELISA that determines the abundance of TRPV1 protein in different tissues. It provides a powerful tool to quantify changes of TRPV1 protein levels in pathological states.},

@article{Lampariello2009,
	Abstract = {The problem of the quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence histograms "with weak labeling" is considered. In these distributions, the fluorescence intensity mean of labeled cells is slightly above that of unlabeled cells, and therefore there is a considerable overlap between the two populations. The procedure of selecting "by eye" an intensity level that separates labeled from unlabeled cells is evidently inadequate, leading to subjective and not reproducible results. Threshold and subtraction methods, although objective, quick, and easy to use, are also inaccurate. Till now, correct enough estimates of the percentage of labeled cells have been obtained only by applying mathematical modeling methods, that are, however, not very easy to handle. A new method for estimating the labeled cell proportion from immunofluorescence histograms is presented. It relies on the analysis of the ratio of the cumulative distributions associated with the routinely available test and negative control histograms. Since this ratio results in a well-defined "sigma-shaped" distribution from a certain channel onwards, a suitable fitting function is used to obtain directly a preliminary estimate of the proportion of labeled cells. Then, an iterative procedure is designed for updating the estimate until it is judged acceptable, according to a suitable criterion. Moreover, to take into account the overall variability in the control data, the estimation process is repeated using the cumulatives associated with replicate negative control histograms. The accuracy of the method was tested with the same set of experimental data analyzed by means of a mathematical modeling method described in a previous article (Lampariello and Aiello, Cytometry 1998;32:241-254). There was a very good agreement between the known and estimated proportions of labeled cells, and the latter were, in many cases, even closer to the true values than those previously obtained. On the basis of the results reported, the method, which is objective, very simple, and much easier to implement than our previously proposed one, appears to be effective in the entire range of the percentage values, and to provide results independent of the acquisition precision.},

	Abstract = {Today, in silico studies and trial simulations already complement experimental approaches in pharmaceutical R&D and have become indispensable tools for decision making and communication with regulatory agencies. While biology is multiscale by nature, project work, and software tools usually focus on isolated aspects of drug action, such as pharmacokinetics at the organism scale or pharmacodynamic interaction on the molecular level. We present a modeling and simulation software platform consisting of PK-Sim{\textregistered} and MoBi{\textregistered} capable of building and simulating models that integrate across biological scales. A prototypical multiscale model for the progression of a pancreatic tumor and its response to pharmacotherapy is constructed and virtual patients are treated with a prodrug activated by hepatic metabolization. Tumor growth is driven by signal transduction leading to cell cycle transition and proliferation. Free tumor concentrations of the active metabolite inhibit Raf kinase in the signaling cascade and thereby cell cycle progression. In a virtual clinical study, the individual therapeutic outcome of the chemotherapeutic intervention is simulated for a large population with heterogeneous genomic background. Thereby, the platform allows efficient model building and integration of biological knowledge and prior data from all biological scales. Experimental in vitro model systems can be linked with observations in animal experiments and clinical trials. The interplay between patients, diseases, and drugs and topics with high clinical relevance such as the role of pharmacogenomics, drug--drug, or drug--metabolite interactions can be addressed using this mechanistic, insight driven multiscale modeling approach.},

	Abstract = {Fundamental to living cells is the capacity to differentiate into subtypes with specialized attributes. Understanding the way cells acquire their fates is a major challenge in developmental biology. How cells adopt a particular fate is usually thought of as being deterministic, and in the large majority of cases it is. That is, cells acquire their fate by virtue of their lineage or their proximity to an inductive signal from another cell. In some cases, however, and in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, cells choose one or another pathway of differentiation stochastically, without apparent regard to environment or history. Stochasticity has important mechanistic requirements. We speculate on why stochasticity is advantageous-and even critical in some circumstances-to the individual, the colony, or the species.},

	series microarray data is presented. A modelling method based on a
	continuous representation
	
	of Boolean functions in the form of Zhegalkin Polynomials is proposed.
	
	Structural information known from theoretical biology like the canalizing

	can be included as well as continuous measurements of gene expression
	levels. As
	
	an example, its applicability to yeast data is demonstrated. The complexity

	the problem requires efficient methods and tools. The discrete set
	of all Canalizing
	
	Boolean models consistent with the measurements is large and grows
	exponentially
	
	as the connectivity degree of each gene increases. This set can be
	defined in terms
	
	of the Zhegalkin Polynomial coefficients. Moreover, this paper gives
	two theorems
	
	on structural properties of Canalizing Zhegalkin Polynomials. An algorithm
	based
	
	upon them shows how these results can be used for identifying Canalizing

	Abstract = {The recently measured yeast transcriptional network is analyzed in terms of simplified Boolean network models, with the aim of determining feasible rule structures, given the requirement of stable solutions of the generated Boolean networks. We find that, for ensembles of generated models, those with canalyzing Boolean rules are remarkably stable, whereas those with random Boolean rules are only marginally stable. Furthermore, substantial parts of the generated networks are frozen, in the sense that they reach the same state, regardless of initial state. Thus, our ensemble approach suggests that the yeast network shows highly ordered dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) uses its second baculovirus IAP repeat domain (BIR2) to inhibit the apoptotic executioner caspase-3 and -7. Structural studies have demonstrated that it is not the BIR2 domain itself but a segment N-terminal to it that directly targets the activity of these caspases. These studies failed to demonstrate a role of the BIR2 domain in inhibition. We used site-directed mutagenesis of BIR2 and its linker to determine the mechanism of executioner caspase inhibition by XIAP. We show that the BIR2 domain contributes substantially to inhibition of executioner caspases. A surface groove on BIR2, which also binds to Smac/DIABLO, interacts with a neoepitope generated at the N-terminus of the caspase small subunit following activation. Therefore, BIR2 uses a two-site interaction mechanism to achieve high specificity and potency for inhibition. Moreover, for caspase-7, the precise location of the activating cleavage is critical for subsequent inhibition. Since apical caspases utilize this cleavage site differently, we predict that the origin of the death stimulus should dictate the efficiency of inhibition by XIAP.},

	Abstract = {Several of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members regulate apoptosis in response to various cellular assaults. Some members are also involved in cell signalling, mitosis and targeting proteins to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery. The most intensively studied family member, X-linked IAP (XIAP), is a potent inhibitor of caspase activity; hence, it is generally assumed that direct caspase inhibition is an important conserved function of most members of the family. Biochemical and structural studies have precisely mapped the elements of XIAP required for caspase inhibition. Intriguingly, these elements are not conserved among IAPs. Here, we review current knowledge of the caspase-inhibitory potential of the human IAPs and show that XIAP is probably the only bona fide caspase inhibitor, suggesting that the other family members never gained the ability to directly inhibit caspase activity.},

	Abstract = {In otherwise homogeneous cell populations, individual cells undergo asynchronous cell cycles. In recent years, interest in this fundamental observation has been boosted by the wide usage of CFSE, a fluorescent dye that allows the precise estimation by flow cytometry of the number of divisions performed by different cells in a population, and thus the generation structure. In this work, we propose two general mathematical frameworks to model the time evolution of generation structure in a cell population. The first modeling framework is more descriptive and assumes that cell division time is distributed in the cell population, due to intrinsic noise in the molecular machinery in individual cells; while the second framework assumes that asynchrony in cell division stems from randomness in the interactions individual cells make with environmental agents. We reduce these formalisms to recover two preexistent models, which build on each of the hypotheses. When confronted to kinetics data on CFSE labeled cells taken from literature, these models can fit precursor frequency distributions at each measured time point. However, they fail to fit the whole kinetics of precursor frequency distributions. In contrast, two extensions of those models, derived also from our general formalisms, fit equally well both the whole kinetics and individual profiles at each time point, providing a biologically reasonable estimation of parameters. We prove that the distribution of cell division times is not Gaussian, as previously proposed, but is better described by an asymmetric distribution such as the Gamma distribution. We show also that the observed cell asynchrony could be explained by the existence of a single transitional event during cell division. Based on these results, we suggest new ways of combining theoretical and experimental work to assess how much of noise in internal machinery of the cell and interactions with the environmental agents contribute to the asynchrony in cell division.},

	Abstract = {The mature, resting immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgD+ B lymphocyte can be induced by T cells to proliferate, switch isotype, and differentiate into Ig-secreting or memory cells. Furthermore, B cell activation results in the de novo expression or loss of a number of cell surface molecules that function in cell recirculation or further interaction with T cells. Here, a novel fluorescent technique reveals that T-dependent B cell activation induces cell surface changes that correlate with division cycle number. Furthermore, striking stepwise changes are often centered on a single round of cell division. Particularly marked was the consistent increase in IgG1+ B cells after the second division cycle, from an initial level of < 3\% IgG1+ to a plateau of approximately 40\% after six cell divisions. The relationship between the percentage of IgG1+ B cells and division number was independent of time after stimulation, indicating a requirement for cell division in isotype switching. IgD expression became negative after four divisions, and a number of changes centered on the sixth division, including the loss of IgM, CD23, and B220. The techniques used here should prove useful for tracking other differentiation pathways and for future analysis of the molecular events associated with stepwise differentiation at the single cell level.},

@article{HyrienZan2008,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in flow cytometry have resulted in the development of powerful bioassays to analyze the proliferation of cell populations. The carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeling experiment is one such assay that is widely used to study cell kinetics and as a standard tool for investigating lymphocyte proliferation. Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe cell proliferation during CFSE experiments. The statistical analysis of CFSE-labeling data has received little attention, but it poses a number of methodological issues. In this article we approach their analysis using a mixture model. The mixing proportions are specified through an age-dependent branching process that models the temporal organization of the cell population. Because the CFSE molecules are partitioned between daughter cells when their mother divides, the observations generated by this assay are dependent. The data structure can be compared with that of a partially observed random-effects model where the clusters cannot be identified. In this context, we propose three estimators. We prove their consistency and asymptotic normality, investigate their finite-sample properties in simulation studies, and contrast their relative merits for the analysis of CFSE-labeling data. We use the proposed methods to analyze the proliferation in vitro of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. In particular, we compare their activation and proliferation rates, and also investigate the effect of two stimuli that activate resting lymphocytes: the nonspecific mitogen phytohemaglutanin (PHA) and ligation of both the T-cell receptor CD3 and the costimulatory receptor CD28 cell surface proteins with monoclonal antibodies.},

	Abstract = {We propose that a cell's life is divided into two fundamentally different parts. Some time after mitosis all cells enter a state (A) in which their activity is not directed towards replication. A cell may remain in the A-state for any lenght of time, throughout which its probability of leaving A-state remains constant. On leaving A-state, cells enter B-phase in which their activities are deterministic, and directed towards replication. Initiation of cell replication processes is thus random, in the sense that radioactive decay is random. Cell population growth rates are determined by the probability with which cells leave the A-state, the duration of the B-phase, and the rate of cell death. Knowledge of these parameters permits precise calculation of the distribution of intermitotic times within populations, the behavior of synchronized cell cultures, and the shape of labeled mitosis curves.},

The fluorescent dye CFSE allows the tracking of cell division in vitro and in vivo and provides a rich source of information with which to test models of cell kinetics. Cell division and death have a stochastic component at the single-cell level, and the probabilities of these occurring in any given time interval may also undergo systematic variation at a population level. This gives rise to heterogeneity in proliferating cell populations. Branching processes provide a natural means of describing this behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Cell division tracking using fluorescent dyes, such as carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, provides a unique opportunity for analysis of cell growth kinetics. The present review article presents new methods for enhancing resolution of division tracking data as well as derivation of quantities that characterize growth from time-series data. These include the average time between successive divisions, the proportion of cells that survive and the proliferation per division. The physical significance of these measured quantities is interpreted by formulation of a two-compartment model of cell cycle transit characterized by stochastic and deterministic cell residence times, respectively. The model confirmed that survival is directly related to the proportion of cells that enter the next cell generation. The proportion of time that cells reside in the stochastic compartment is directly related to the proliferation per generation. This form of analysis provides a starting point for more sophisticated physical and biochemical models of cell cycle regulation.},

	Abstract = {Cellular proliferation is an essential feature of the adaptive immune response. The introduction of the division tracking dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) has made it possible to monitor the number of cell divisions during proliferation and to examine the relationship between proliferation and differentiation. Although qualitative examination of CFSE data may be useful, substantially more information about division and death rates can be extracted from quantitative CFSE time-series experiments. Quantitative methods can reveal in detail how lymphocyte proliferation and survival are regulated and altered by signals such as those received from co-stimulatory molecules, drugs and genetic polymorphisms. In this protocol, we present a detailed method for examining time-series data using graphical and computer-based procedures available to all experimenters.},

	Abstract = {The fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) classifies proliferating cell populations into groups according to the number of divisions each cell has undergone (i.e., its division class). The pulse labeling of cells with radioactive thymidine provides a means to determine the distribution of times of entry into the first cell division. We derive in analytic form the number of cells in each division class as a function of time based on the distribution of times to the first division. Choosing the distribution of time to the first division to fit thymidine labeling data for T cells stimulated in vitro under different concentrations of IL-2, we fit CFSE data to determine the dependence of T cell kinetic parameters on the concentration of IL-2. As the concentration of IL-2 increases, the average cell cycle time is shortened, the death rate of cells is decreased, and a higher fraction of cells is recruited into division. We also find that if the average cell cycle time increases with division class then the qualify of our fit to the data improves.},

	Abstract = {Since its introduction in 1994 (J. Immunol. Methods 171 (1994) 131), the flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte proliferation by serial halving of the fluorescence intensity of the vital dye CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester or CFDA-SE) has become widely used in immunological laboratories around the world. This technique allows the visualisation of eight to 10 discrete cycles of cell division by flow cytometry, both in vitro and in vivo. Appropriately conjugated antibodies can be used to probe surface marker changes as cells divide, or changes in expression of internal molecules such as cytokines when appropriate fixation and permeabilisation protocols are used. An added advantage of the technique is the ability to recover viable cells which have undergone defined numbers of cell divisions by flow cytometric sorting, allowing functional studies to be performed. Other commonly used assays of cell proliferation give only limited information, as they usually measure division at a population level. The CFSE technique can be used to determine kinetics of immune responses, track proliferation in minor subsets of cells and follow the acquisition of differentiation markers or internal proteins linked to cell division.},

@article{LuzyaninaMru2007,
	Abstract = {CFSE based tracking of the lymphocyte proliferation using flow cytometry is a powerful experimental technique in immunology allowing for the tracing of labelled cell populations over time in terms of the number of divisions cells undergone. Interpretation and understanding of such population data can be greatly improved through the use of mathematical modelling. We apply a heterogenous linear compartmental model, described by a system of ordinary differential equations similar to those proposed by Kendall. This model allows division number-dependent rates of cell proliferation and death and describes the rate of changes in the numbers of cells having undergone j divisions. The experimental data set that we specifically analyze specifies the following characteristics of the kinetics of PHA-induced human T lymphocyte proliferation assay in vitro: (1) the total number of live cells, (2) the total number of dead but not disintegrated cells and (3) the number of cells divided j times. Following the maximum likelihood approach for data fitting, we estimate the model parameters which, in particular, present the CTL birth- and death rate "functions". It is the first study of CFSE labelling data which convincingly shows that the lymphocyte proliferation and death both in vitro and in vivo are division number dependent. For the first time, the confidence in the estimated parameter values is analyzed by comparing three major methods: the technique based on the variance-covariance matrix, the profile-likelihood-based approach and the bootstrap technique. We compare results and performance of these methods with respect to their robustness and computational cost. We show that for evaluating mathematical models of differing complexity the information-theoretic approach, based upon indicators measuring the information loss for a particular model (Kullback-Leibler information), provides a consistent basis. We specifically discuss methodological and computational difficulties in parameter identification with CFSE data, e.g. the loss of confidence in the parameter estimates starting around the sixth division. Overall, our study suggests that the heterogeneity inherent in cell kinetics should be explicitly incorporated into the structure of mathematical models.},

	Abstract = {CFSE analysis of a proliferating cell population is a popular tool for the study of cell division and divisionlinked changes in cell behavior. Recently Banks et al. (2011), Luzyanina et al. (2009), Luzyanina et al. (2007), a partial differential equation (PDE) model to describe lymphocyte dynamics in a CFSE proliferation assay was proposed. We present a significant revision of this model which improves the physiological understanding of several parameters. Namely, the parameter used previously as a heuristic explanation for the dilution of CFSE dye by cell division is replaced with a more physical component, cellular autofluorescence. The rate at which label decays is also quantified using a Gompertz decay process. We then demonstrate a revised method of fitting the model to the commonly used histogram representation of the data. It is shown that these improvements result in a model with a strong physiological basis which is fully capable of replicating the behavior observed in the data.},

Other methods exist which can quantify overall division, but tell nothing about the division history of individual cells. Here we present a new technique in which an intracellular fluorescent label is divided equally between daughter cells upon cell division. The technique is applicable to in vitro cell division, as well as in vivo division of adoptively transferred cells, and can resolve multiple successive generations using flow cytometry. The label is fluorescein derived, allowing monoclonal antibodies conjugated to phycoerythrin or other compatible fluorochromes to be used to immunophenotype the dividing cells.},

	Abstract = {Several sigmoidal functions (logistic, Gompertz, Richards, Schnute, and Stannard) were compared to describe a bacterial growth curve. They were compared statistically by using the model of Schnute, which is a comprehensive model, encompassing all other models. The t test and the F test were used. With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use.},

We construct stochastic linear multistep methods and develop the fundamental numerical analysis concerning their mean-square consistency, numerical stability in the mean-square sense and mean-square convergence. For the special case of two-step Maruyama schemes we derive conditions guaranteeing their mean-square consistency. Further, for the small noise case we obtain expansions of the local error in terms of the step size and the small parameter $\epsilon$. Simulation results using several explicit and implicit stochastic linear k-step schemes, k=1,2, illustrate the theoretical findings.},

	Abstract = {Bacteria are single-celled organisms which often display heterogeneous behaviour, even among populations of genetically identical cells in uniform environmental conditions. Markov process models arising from the theory of stochastic chemical kinetics are often used to understand the genetic regulation of the behaviour of individual bacterial cells. However, such models often contain uncertain parameters which need to be estimated from experimental data. Parameter estimation for complex high-dimensional Markov process models using diverse, partial, noisy and poorly calibrated time-course experimental data is a challenging inferential problem, but a computationally intensive Bayesian approach turns out to be effective. The utility and addedvalue of the approach is demonstrated in the context of a stochastic model of a key cellular decision made by the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, using quantitative data from single-cell fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry experiments.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of two fundamental laws concerning cellular dynamics with recursive growth is reported. Firstly, the chemical abundances measured over many cells were found to obey a log-normal distribution and secondly, the relationship between the average and standard deviation of the abundances was found to be linear. The ubiquity of these laws was explored both theoretically and experimentally. By means of a model with a catalytic reaction network, the laws were shown to exist near a critical state with efficient self-reproduction. Additionally, by measuring distributions of fluorescent proteins in bacteria cells, the ubiquity of log-normal distribution of protein abundances was confirmed. Relevance of these findings to cellular function and biological plasticity is briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {Cellular decision making is the process whereby cells assume different, functionally important and heritable fates without an associated genetic or environmental difference. Such stochastic cell fate decisions generate nongenetic cellular diversity, which may be critical for metazoan development as well as optimized microbial resource utilization and survival in a fluctuating, frequently stressful environment. Here, we review several examples of cellular decision making from viruses, bacteria, yeast, lower metazoans, and mammals, highlighting the role of regulatory network structure and molecular noise. We propose that cellular decision making is one of at least three key processes underlying development at various scales of biological organization.},

	Abstract = {Human-made information relay systems invariably incorporate central regulatory components, which are mirrored in biological systems by dense feedback and feedforward loops. This type of system control is exemplified by positive and negative feedback loops (for example, receptor endocytosis and dephosphorylation) that enable growth factors and receptor Tyr kinases of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB family to regulate cellular function. Recent studies show that the collection of feedback regulatory loops can perform computational tasks - such as decoding ligand specificity, transforming graded input signals into a digital output and regulating response kinetics. Aberrant signal processing and feedback regulation can lead to defects associated with pathologies such as cancer.},

Thus, the bridge between the mathematical sciences and other disciplines is heavily traveled. The correspondingly increased dialog between the disciplines has led to the establishment of the series: Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics.

The purpose of this series is to meet the current and future needs for the interaction between various science and technology areas on the one hand and mathematics on the other. This is done, firstly, by encouraging the ways that mathematics may be applied in traditional areas, as well as point towards new and innovative areas of applications; and, secondly, by encouraging other scientific disciplines to engage in a dialog with mathematicians outlining their problems to both access new methods and suggest innovative developments within mathematics itself.

The series will consist of monographs and high-level texts from researchers working on the interplay between mathematics and other fields of science and technology.},

	Abstract = {We present a new approach to the handling and interrogating of large flow cytometry data where cell status and function can be described, at the population level, by global descriptors such as distribution mean or co-efficient of variation experimental data. Here we link the "real" data to initialise a computer simulation of the cell cycle that mimics the evolution of individual cells within a larger population and simulates the associated changes in fluorescence intensity of functional reporters. The model is based on stochastic formulations of cell cycle progression and cell division and uses evolutionary algorithms, allied to further experimental data sets, to optimise the system variables. At the population level, the in-silico cells provide the same statistical distributions of fluorescence as their real counterparts; in addition the model maintains information at the single cell level. The cell model is demonstrated in the analysis of cell cycle perturbation in human osteosarcoma tumour cells, using the topoisomerase II inhibitor, ICRF-193. The simulation gives a continuous temporal description of the pharmacodynamics between discrete experimental analysis points with a 24 hour interval; providing quantitative assessment of inter-mitotic time variation, drug interaction time constants and sub-population fractions within normal and polyploid cell cycles. Repeated simulations indicate a model accuracy of +/-5\%. The development of a simulated cell model, initialized and calibrated by reference to experimental data, provides an analysis tool in which biological knowledge can be obtained directly via interrogation of the in-silico cell population. It is envisaged that this approach to the study of cell biology by simulating a virtual cell population pertinent to the data available can be applied to "generic" cell-based outputs including experimental data from imaging platforms.},

	Abstract = {The stochastic dynamics of a well-stirred mixture of molecular species interacting through different biochemical reactions can be accurately modelled by the chemical master equation (CME). Research in the biology and scientific computing community has concentrated mostly on the development of numerical techniques to approximate the solution of the CME via many realizations of the associated Markov jump process. The domain of exact and/or efficient methods for directly solving the CME is still widely open, which is due to its large dimension that grows exponentially with the number of molecular species involved. In this article, we present an exact solution formula of the CME for arbitrary initial conditions in the case where the underlying system is governed by monomolecular reactions. The solution can be expressed in terms of the convolution of multinomial and product Poisson distributions with time-dependent parameters evolving according to the traditional reaction-rate equations. This very structured representation allows to deduce easily many properties of the solution. The model class includes many interesting examples. For more complex reaction systems, our results can be seen as a first step towards the construction of new numerical integrators, because solutions to the monomolecular case provide promising ansatz functions for Galerkin-type methods.},

@article{KiefferWal2011,
	Abstract = {This paper is about guaranteed parameter estimation in two contexts, namely bounded-error and optimal estimation. In bounded-error estimation, one looks for the set of all parameter vectors that are consistent with some prior bounds on the errors deemed acceptable between the model behavior and that of the system. In optimal estimation, one looks for the set of all parameter vectors that minimize some cost function quantifying the discrepancy between the behaviors of the system and its model. In both cases, guaranteed means that proven statements are made about the set of interest. The situation is made much more difficult when the model output is assumed to depend nonlinearly in the parameters to be estimated and when dealing with continuous-time models, as here. Important tools based on interval analysis (IA) that contribute to allowing guaranteed estimation in these challenging conditions are presented. Some are absolutely classical in the context of IA but not so well known in the community of parameter estimation at large. Others have been developed recently and were mainly presented in conferences. Some, such as the use of sensitivity functions to reduce more quickly the size of outer approximations of the sets of interest, are new. Challenges for future research in the context of guaranteed nonlinear estimation are mentioned.},

First, stochastic models are being used increasingly in preference to deterministic models to describe biochemical network dynamics at the single-cell level. Second, sophisticated statistical methods and algorithms are being used to fit both deterministic and stochastic models to time course and other experimental data. Both frameworks are needed to adequately describe observed noise, variability and heterogeneity of biological systems over a range of scales of biological organization.},

In most cases, this determinism represents largely uncharacterized molecular regulatory mechanisms, which places the study of cell-to-cell variability in the realm of molecular cell biology.

@misc{HasenauerAnd2011,
	Abstract = {Background: Analysis of heterogeneous populations often aims to distinguish underlying subgroups, and to evaluate the contribution of the subpopulations to the overall population. Common approaches are threshold-based. The determination of a threshold is relatively easy for partially overlapping populations (see Figure~\ref{fig: threshold_analysis_good}). But these approaches fail for complex and strongly overlapping heterogeneous populations (see Figure~\ref{fig: threshold_analysis_bad}). A mathematical sound assessment of the size of responsive subpopulations of highly heterogeneous cell systems is urgently needed. 

Results: In cell biology commonly population statistics are of interest. We describe a threshold-free method to determine the minimal percentage of responsive cells, irrespective of the response of the single cells. In contrast to threshold-based methods a kernel density estimator is applied to evaluate the population density, before and after the stimulus. As the population density determined for the former condition does not contain a subgroup which responded, while the latter one does, the densities allow the calculation of the minimal percentage of responsive cells by mere subtraction and integration.
The method is applied to data derived from highly heterogeneous DRG-neurons quantified by an automated immunfluorescence-microscopy. After treatment with the nerve growth factor, NGF, the phosphorylation status of the kinase Erk1/2 is measured as fluorescence-intensity in single cells. The proposed method provides reliable estimates of the percentage of NGF responsive cells, which could be shown to be significant.

Conclusion: In this work a threshold-free method is proposed for assessing the responsiveness of heterogeneous cell populations. It has been applied to kinase activation data obtained from DRG-neurons,  a cell system not feasible for common threshold-based methods. As the method is threshold-free it can be transferred to other biological questions.

	Abstract = {In recent years, a great deal of attention has been devoted to Krylov subspace techniques for reduced-order modeling of large-scale dynamical systems. The surge of interest was triggered by the pressing need for efficient numerical techniques for simulations of extremely large-scale dynamical systems arising from circuit simulation, structural dynamics, and microelectromechanical systems. In this paper, we begin with a tutorial of a Lanczos process based Krylov subspace technique for reduced-order modeling of linear dynamical systems, and then give an overview of the recent progress in other Krylov subspace techniques for a variety of dynamical systems, including second-order and nonlinear systems. Case studies arising from circuit simulation, structural dynamics and microelectromechanical systems are presented.},

	Abstract = {In many fields of science and engineering, like fluid or structural mechanics and electric circuit design, large-scale dynamical systems need to be simulated, optimized or controlled. They are often given by discretizations of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations yielding high-dimensional discrete phase spaces. For this reason during the last decades research was mainly focused on the development of sophisticated analytical and numerical tools to understand the overall system behavior. Not surprisingly, the number of degrees of freedom for simulations keptpace with the increasing computing power. But when it comes to optimal design or control the problems are in general to large to be tackled with standard techniques. Hence, there is a strong need for model reduction techniques to reduce the computational costs and storage requirements. They should yield low-dimensional approximations for the full high-dimensional dynamical system, which reproduce the characteristic dynamics of the system.},

	Abstract = {We present a framework for applying the method of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Galerkin projection to compressible fluids. For incompressible flows, only the kinematic variables are important, and the techniques are well known. In a compressible flow, both the kinematic and thermodynamic variables are dynamically important, and must be included in the configuration space. We introduce an energy-based inner product which may be used to obtain POD modes for this configuration space. We then obtain an approximate version of the Navier--Stokes equations, valid for cold flows at moderate Mach number, and project these equations onto a POD basis. The resulting equations of motion are quadratic, and are much simpler than projections of the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations.},

@article{HasenauerWal2011b,
	Abstract = {In many biological processes heterogeneity within clonal cell populations is an important issue. One of the most striking examples is a population of cancer cells in which after a common, identical death signal some cells die whereas others survive. The reason for this heterogeneity is intrinsic and extrinsic noise.

In this paper we present a mechanistic multi-scale modeling framework for cell populations, in which the dynamics of every individual cell is captured by a parameter dependent stochastic differential equation (SDE). Heterogeneity among individual cells is accounted for by differences in parameter values, modeling extrinsic influences. Based on the statistical properties of the extrinsic noise and the SDE model for the individual cell, a partial differential equation (PDE) model is derived. This PDE describes the evolution of the population density. To determine the statistics of the extrinsic noise from experimental population data, a density-based statistical data model of the noise-corrupted data is derived. Employing this data model we show that the statistics of the extrinsic can be computed using a convex optimization. This efficient way of assessing the parameters allows for a so far infeasible uncertainty analysis via bootstrapping.

To evaluate the proposed method, a model for the caspase activation cascade is considered. It is shown that for known noise properties the unknown parameter densities in this model are well estimated by the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {Detailed first-principles models of transport and reaction (based on partial differential equations) lead, after discretization, to dynamical systems of very high order. Systematic methodologies for model order reduction are vital in exploiting such fundamental models in the analysis, design and real-time control of distributed reacting systems. We briefly review some approaches to model order reduction we have successfully used in recent years, and illustrate their capabilities through (a) the design of an observer and stabilizing controller of a reaction-diffusion problem and (b) two-dimensional simulations of the transient behavior of a horizontal MOVPE reactor.

	Abstract = {Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been effectively applied for many process systems. However, linear MPC is often inappropriate for controlling non-linear large-scale systems. To overcome this, model reduction methodology has been exploited to enable the efficient application of linear MPC for non-linear distributed-parameter systems. An implementation of the proper orthogonal decomposition method combined with a finite element Galerkin projection is first used to extract accurate non-linear low-order models from the large-scale ones. Then a Trajectory Piecewise-Linear method is developed to construct a piecewise linear representation of the reduced non-linear model. Linear MPC, based on quadratic programming, can then be efficiently performed on the resulting system. The stabilisation of the oscillatory behaviour of a tubular reactor with recycle is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate our methodology.},

	Abstract = {The inverse problem of using measurements to estimate unknown parameters of a system often arises in engineering practice and scientific research. This paper proposes a Collage-based parameter inversion framework for a class of partial differential equations. The Collage method is used to convert the parameter estimation inverse problem into a minimization problem of a function of several variables after the partial differential equation is approximated by a differential dynamical system. Then numerical schemes for solving this minimization problem are proposed, including grid approximation and ant colony optimization. The proposed schemes are applied to a parameter estimation problem for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii equation, and the results show that the proposed approximation method is efficient for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations with respect to unknown parameters. At worst, the presented method provides an excellent starting point for traditional inversion methods that must first select a good starting point.},

An on-line sequential analysis of the temperature measurements along the length of the reactor, allows a fast and time-adaptive selection of the best measurements to be used in a low order, simple and robust control scheme. The approach has been developed for both static and dynamic cases. It is based on a recursive computation of the state estimate errors. Its theoretical and computational simplicity makes it attractive for on-line implementation. The procedure has been applied for the adaptive tubular reactor under pseudo-steady state and dynamic conditions with very encouraging results.},

The problem is tackled by extending a dissipativity theory-based observer design for nonlinear finite-dimensional systems, which has been recently applied to a class of continuous stirred tank reactors. The underlying idea of the proposed observer approach consists in designing the tubular reactor data-assimilation scheme so that the estimation error dynamics are given by a two-dissipative system interconnection: one linear distributed dynamical system with the convective and diffusive mechanisms, and one nonlinear lumped static system with the reaction kinetics. The approach is applied to a tubular reactor with non-monotonic kinetics and boundary measurements, and the associated sufficient solvability condition was identified and interpreted in terms of dissipativity and dimensionless numbers with physical meaning.},

	Abstract = {Model (order) reduction, MOR for short, is an ubiquitous tool in the analysis and simulation of dynamical systems, control design, circuit simulation, structural dynamics, CFD, etc. In systems and control, MOR methods based on balanced truncation (BT) and its relatives have been widely used. In other areas, they have been less successful as it is common belief that their computational complexity is too high to apply them to large-scale problems involving sparse matrices. We will review the recent development of efficient algorithms for solving matrix equations that make balancing-related model reduction methods competitive to other MOR approaches - these new implementations fall into the same complexity class as the omnipresent Krylov subspace methods. As balancing-related methods offer the advantage of computable error bounds that allow for an adaptive choice of the order of the reduced model and moreover, they can be shown to preserve certain system properties like stability, passivity, dissipativity, etc., these new BT implementations become attractive in various application areas. These include
- nanoelectronics/VLSI design, where MOR is inevitable for circuit simulation,
- (optimal) control of physical processes described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
- inverse problems related to the identification of input signals, e.g., for tracking control.
We will discuss some particular aspects arising in these areas when applying BT-related MOR techniques. The performance of several BT-related approaches will be demonstrated using examples from a variety of application areas},

	Abstract = {We derive an efficient reduced basis method for finite volume approximations of parameterized linear advection-diffusion equations. An important step in deriving a reduced finite volume model with the reduced basis technology is the generation of a reduced basis space, on which the detailed numerical simulations are projected. We present a new strategy for this reduced basis generation. We apply an effective exploration of the parameter space by adaptive grids based on an a posteriori error estimate. The resulting method gives a considerable improvement concerning equal distribution of the model error over the parameter space compared to uniform parameter selections. It is computationally very efficient in terms of small ratio of training-time over model-error.},

@article{WuerstleLau2011,
	Abstract = {Apoptosis is driven by positive feedback activation between aspartate-specific cysteinyl proteases (caspases). These feedback loops ensure the swift and efficient elimination of cells upon initiation of apoptosis execution. At the same time, the signaling network must be insensitive to erroneous, mild caspase activation to avoid unwanted, excessive cell death. Sublethal caspase activation in fact was shown to be a requirement for the differentiation of multiple cell types but might also occur accidentally during short, transient cellular stress conditions. Here we carried out an in silico comparison of the molecular mechanisms that so far have been identified to impair the amplification of caspase activities via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop. In a systems model resembling HeLa cervical cancer cells, the dimerization/dissociation balance of caspase-8 potently suppressed the amplification of caspase responses, surprisingly outperforming or matching known caspase-8 and -3 inhibitors such as bifunctional apoptosis repressor or x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. These findings were further substantiated in global sensitivity analyses based on combinations of protein concentrations from the sub- to superphysiological range to screen the full spectrum of biological variability that can be expected within cell populations and between distinct cell types. Additional modeling showed that the combined effects of x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation processes can also provide resistance to larger inputs of active caspases. Our study therefore highlights a central and so far underappreciated role of caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation in avoiding unwanted cell death by lethal amplification of caspase responses via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop.},

	Abstract = {Activation of effector caspases is a final step during apoptosis. Single-cell imaging studies have demonstrated that this process may occur as a rapid, all-or-none response, triggering a complete substrate cleavage within 15 min. Based on biochemical data from HeLa cells, we have developed a computational model of apoptosome-dependent caspase activation that was sufficient to remodel the rapid kinetics of effector caspase activation observed in vivo. Sensitivity analyses predicted a critical role for caspase-3-dependent feedback signalling and the X-linked-inhibitor-of-apoptosis-protein (XIAP), but a less prominent role for the XIAP antagonist Smac. Single-cell experiments employing a caspase fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate verified these model predictions qualitatively and quantitatively. XIAP was predicted to control this all-or-none response, with concentrations as high as 0.15 M enabling, but concentrations >0.30 M significantly blocking substrate cleavage. Overexpression of XIAP within these threshold concentrations produced cells showing slow effector caspase activation and submaximal substrate cleavage. Our study supports the hypothesis that high levels of XIAP control caspase activation and substrate cleavage, and may promote apoptosis resistance and sublethal caspase activation in vivo.},

	Abstract = {In the past years it has become evident that stochastic effects in regulatory networks play an important role, leading to an increasing in stochastic modelling attempts. In contrast, metabolic networks involving large numbers of molecules are most often modelled deterministically. Going towards the integration of different model systems, gen-regulatory networks become part of a larger model system including signalling pathways and metabolic networks. Thus, the question arises of how to efficiently and accurately simulation such coupled or hybrid systems. We present an algorithmic approach for the simulation of hybrid stochastic and deterministic reaction models that allows for adaptive step-size integration of the deterministic equations while at the same time accurately tracing the stochastic reaction events. We present a mathematical derivation of the hybrid system on the stochastic process level, and present numerical examples that outline the power of hybrid simulations.

	Abstract = {It is well-known that distributed parameter computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models provide more accurate results than conventional, lumped-parameter unit operation models used in process simulation. Consequently, the use of CFD models in process/equipment co-simulation offers the potential to optimize overall plant performance with respect to complex thermal and fluid flow phenomena. Because solving CFD models is time-consuming compared to the overall process simulation, we consider the development of fast reduced order models (ROMs) based on CFD results to closely approximate the high-fidelity equipment models in the co-simulation. By considering process equipment items with complicated geometries and detailed thermodynamic property models, this study proposes a strategy to develop ROMs based on principal component analysis (PCA). Taking advantage of commercial process simulation and CFD software (for example, Aspen Plus and FLUENT), we are able to develop systematic CFD-based ROMs for equipment models in an efficient manner. In particular, we show that the validity of the ROM is more robust within well-sampled input domain and the CPU time is significantly reduced. Typically, it takes at most several CPU seconds to evaluate the ROM compared to several CPU hours or more to solve the CFD model. Two case studies, involving two power plant equipment examples, are described and demonstrate the benefits of using our proposed ROM methodology for process simulation and optimization.},

	Abstract = {A novel sequential approach for solving dynamic optimization problems containing path constraints on state variables is presented and its performance analyzed. As in the simultaneous approach, we discretize both state and control variables using collocation on finite elements, so that path constraints can be guaranteed inside each element. The state variables are solved in a manner similar to that in the sequential approach; this eliminates the discretized differential-algebraic equations and state variables, so that the problem is reduced to a smaller problem only with inequality constraints and control variables. Therefore, it possesses advantages of both the simultaneous and the sequential approach. Furthermore, the elimination of the equality constraints substantially simplifies the line search problem and thus larger steps can be taken by successive quadratic programming (SQP) toward the optimum. We call this dynamic optimization method a quasi-sequential approach. We compare this new approach with the simultaneous approach in terms of computational cost and by analyzing the solution path. A highly nonlinear reactor control and the optimal operation of a heatintegrated column system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. As a result, it can be concluded that this quasi-sequential approach is well suited for solving highly nonlinear large-scale optimal control problems.},

Because our desired operating conditions are at unstable points, we apply a simultaneous dynamic optimization (SDO) approach, where state and control variables in the optimal control problem are discretized and a large-scale nonlinear programming solver is applied. For this purpose, we consider Radau collocation on finite elements and the IPOPT NLP solver. In addition, we describe the stability of the SDO strategy through the presentation of dichotomy properties for boundary-value problems. The resulting SDO approach is then demonstrated on a wide variety of operating scenarios for the high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) reactor, with highly reliable and efficient performance results.},

	Abstract = {Models of dynamical systems become increasingly complex. While this allows a more accurate description of the underlying process, it often renders the application of model-based control algorithms infeasible.
In this paper, we propose a model reduction procedure for systems described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The reduced model used to approximate the input-output map of the system is parameterized using the observability normal form. To preserve the steady states of the system and their stability properties, the set of feasible parameters of the reduced model has to be constrained. Therefore, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for simultaneous exponential stability of a set of steady states of the nonlinear reduced model. The local approximation of these constraints results in a sequential convex program for computing the optimal parameters.
The proposed approach is evaluated using the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model.},

	Abstract = {Negative feedback is common in biological processes and can increase a system's stability to internal and external perturbations. But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell assays have focused attention on the fact that even members of a genetically identical group of cells or organisms in identical environments can exhibit variability in drug sensitivity, cellular response, and phenotype. Underlying much of this variability is stochasticity in gene expression, which can produce unique proteomes even in genetically identical cells. Here we discuss the consequences of non-genetic cell-to-cell variability in the cellular response to drugs and its potential impact for the treatment of human disease.},

	Abstract = {The genetic circuits that regulate cellular functions are subject to stochastic fluctuations, or `noise', in the levels of their components. Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables. We further indicate some of the important challenges and opportunities going forward.},

	Abstract = {The quantitative relation between transcription factor concentrations and the rate of protein production from downstream genes is central to the function of genetic networks. Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter PR in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

@article{SwainElo2002,
	Abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or ``noisy,'' process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates ``intrinsic'' noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent ``extrinsic'' noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than ≃2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable---a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.

	Abstract = {This study explores the dilemma in cellular signaling that triggering of CD95 (Fas/APO-1) in some situations results in cell death and in others leads to the activation of NF-κB. We established an integrated kinetic mathematical model for CD95-mediated apoptotic and NF-κB signaling. Systematic model reduction resulted in a surprisingly simple model well approximating experimentally observed dynamics. The model postulates a new link between c-FLIPL cleavage in the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and the NF-κB pathway. We validated experimentally that CD95 stimulation resulted in an interaction of p43-FLIP with the IKK complex followed by its activation. Furthermore, we showed that the apoptotic and NF-κB pathways diverge already at the DISC. Model and experimental analysis of DISC formation showed that a subtle balance of c-FLIPL and procaspase-8 determines life/death decisions in a nonlinear manner. We present an integrated model describing the complex dynamics of CD95-mediated apoptosis and NF-κB signaling.},

	Abstract = {Computational models are increasingly used to understand and predict complex biological phenomena. These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

The algorithm is based on a ``cone complementarity '' formulation of the problem and is guaranteed to produce a stabilizing controller of order m n 0 max(nu;ny), matching a generic stabilizability result of Davison and Chatterjee [7]. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm finds a controller with order less than or equal to that predicted by Kimura's generic stabilizability result (m n0nu0ny+1). A similar algorithm can be applied to a variety of control problems, including robust control synthesis.

@article{vanRielSon2006,
	Abstract = {Biological complexity and limited quantitative measurements pose severe challenges to standard engineering methodologies for modelling and simulation of genes and gene products integrated in a functional network. In particular, parameter quantification is a bottleneck, and therefore parameter estimation, identifiability, and optimal experiment design are important research topics in systems biology. An approach is presented in which unmodelled dynamics are replaced by fictitious `dependent inputs'. The dependent input approach is particularly useful in validation experiments, because it allows one to fit model parameters to experimental data generated by a reference cell type (`wild-type') and then test this model on data generated by a variation (`mutant'), so long as the mutations only affect the unmodelled dynamics that produce the dependent inputs. Another novel feature of the approach is in the inclusion of a priori information in a multi-objective identification criterion, making it possible to obtain estimates of parameter values and their variances from a relatively limited experimental data set. The pathways that control the nitrogen uptake fluxes in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have been studied. Well-defined perturbation experiments were performed on cells growing in steady-state. Time-series data of extracellular and intracellular metabolites were obtained, as well as mRNA levels. A nonlinear model was proposed and was shown to be structurally identifiable given data of its inputs and outputs. The identified model is a reliable representation of the metabolic system, as it could correctly describe the responses of mutant cells and different perturbations.},

	Abstract = {Clonal populations of cells exhibit substantial phenotypic variation. Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new class of population models for cell proliferation. In contrast to existing models, the proposed model incorporates both discrete age structure and continuous label dynamics. This allows the integration of division number-dependent parameters. It is shown that under mild assumptions the resulting set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) can be decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a set of decoupled PDEs. The decoupled PDEs can be solved analytically, which extremely simplifies the solution of the overall model. Finally, it is illustrated how the model can be employed to efficiently simulate complex proliferating populations.

For example, the algorithm finds the v vertices of a polyhedron in R d defined by a nondegenerate system of n inequalities (or, dually, the v facets of the convex hull of n points in R d, where each facet contains exactly d given points) in time O(ndv) and O(nd) space. The v vertices in a simple arrangement of n hyperplanes in R d can be found in O(n2dv) time and O(nd) space complexity. The algorithm is based on inverting finite pivot algorithms for linear programming.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Elementary flux modes (EFMs)---non-decomposable minimal pathways---are commonly accepted tools for metabolic network analysis under steady state conditions. Valid states of the network are linear superpositions of elementary modes shaping a polyhedral cone (the flux cone), which is a well-studied convex set in computational geometry. Computing EFMs is thus basically equivalent to extreme ray enumeration of polyhedral cones. This is a combinatorial problem with poorly scaling algorithms, preventing the large-scale analysis of metabolic networks so far.

Results: Here, we introduce new algorithmic concepts that enable large-scale computation of EFMs. Distinguishing extreme rays from normal (composite) vectors is one critical aspect of the algorithm. We present a new recursive enumeration strategy with bit pattern trees for adjacent rays---the ancestors of extreme rays---that is roughly one order of magnitude faster than previous methods. Additionally, we introduce a rank updating method that is particularly well suited for parallel computation and a residue arithmetic method for matrix rank computations, which circumvents potential numerical instability problems. Multi-core architectures of modern CPUs can be exploited for further performance improvements. The methods are applied to a central metabolism network of Escherichia coli, resulting in ≈26 Mio. EFMs. Within the top 2% modes considering biomass production, most of the gain in flux variability is achieved. In addition, we compute ≈5 Mio. EFMs for the production of non-essential amino acids for a genome-scale metabolic network of Helicobacter pylori. Only large-scale EFM analysis reveals the >85% of modes that generate several amino acids simultaneously.

Availability: An implementation in Java, with integration into MATLAB and support of various input formats, including SBML, is available at http://www.csb.ethz.ch in the tools section; sources are available from the authors upon request.},

	Abstract = {We address the design of optimally decentralized controllers for linear discrete-time systems. Decentralized controllers are designed that use local measurements and a minimal number of additional measurement links between the subsystems and the controllers. The structure of the decentralized controller, i.e. the additional links between the subsystems and the controllers, is not specified in advance but included into the controller design. We consider state feedback for higher order subsystems and define a pattern matrix to deal with the block structure of the controller. We formulate this problem as a maximization of the degree of decentralization, subject to a given error performance in terms of the H1-norm between the centralized and the decentralized closed loop. For the resulting non-convex optimization problem, numerically tractable convex relaxations are provided and an example shows the effectiveness of this approach.},

	Abstract = {The clinical performance of a laboratory test can be described in terms of diagnostic accuracy, or the ability to correctly classify subjects into clinically relevant subgroups. Diagnostic accuracy refers to the quality of the information provided by the classification device and should be distinguished from the usefulness, or actual practical value, of the information. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots provide a pure index of accuracy by demonstrating the limits of a test's ability to discriminate between alternative states of health over the complete spectrum of operating conditions. Furthermore, ROC plots occupy a central or unifying position in the process of assessing and using diagnostic tools. Once the plot is generated, a user can readily go on to many other activities such as performing quantitative ROC analysis and comparisons of tests, using likelihood ratio to revise the probability of disease in individual subjects, selecting decision thresholds, using logistic-regression analysis, using discriminant-function analysis, or incorporating the tool into a clinical strategy by using decision analysis.},

@article{StamatakisZyg2010,
	Abstract = {Several approaches have been used in the past to model heterogeneity in bacterial cell populations, with each approach focusing on different source(s) of heterogeneity. However, a holistic approach that integrates all the major sources into a comprehensive framework applicable to cell populations is still lacking.
In this work we present the mathematical formulation of a cell population master equation (CPME) that describes cell population dynamics and takes into account the major sources of heterogeneity, namely stochasticity in reaction, DNA-duplication, and division, as well as the random partitioning of species contents into the two daughter cells. The formulation also takes into account cell growth and respects the discrete nature of the molecular contents and cell numbers. We further develop a Monte Carlo algorithm for the simulation of the stochastic processes considered here. To benchmark our new framework, we first use it to quantify the effect of each source of heterogeneity on the intrinsic and the extrinsic phenotypic variability for the well-known two-promoter system used experimentally by Elowitz et al. (2002). We finally apply our framework to a more complicated system and demonstrate how the interplay between noisy gene expression and growth inhibition due to protein accumulation at the single cell level can result in complex behavior at the cell population level.
The generality of our framework makes it suitable for studying a vast array of artificial and natural genetic networks. Using our Monte Carlo algorithm, cell population distributions can be predicted for the genetic architecture of interest, thereby quantifying the effect of stochasticity in intracellular reactions or the variability in the rate of physiological processes such as growth and division. Such in silico experiments can give insight into the behavior of cell populations and reveal the major sources contributing to cell population heterogeneity.},

The problem is known to be NP-hard (for variable n) when Phi is the pth power of the classical p-norm. The present reexamination of the problem establishes NP-hardness for a wider class of functions, and for the p-norm it proves the NP-hardness of maximization over n-dimensional parallelotopes that are centered at the origin or have a vertex there. This in turn implies the NP-hardness of (1,-1) maximization and (0,1)-maximization of a positive definite quadratic form. On the "good" side, there is an efficient algorithm for maximizing the Euclidean norm over an arbitrary rectangular parallelotope.},

@article{KassemAnk1997,
	Abstract = {The proliferative capacity and cellular and biochemical characteristics of human trabecular bone osteoblasts were analysed throughout their replicative lifespan in vitro. Like several other cell types, human osteoblasts demonstrated a typical Hayflick phenomenon of cellular aging comprising a period of rapid proliferation until cumulative population doubling level (CPDL) 22 to 24, followed by a phase of slow growth and the final cessation of cell division at CPDL 32 to 34. Comparing young cells (less than 20% lifespan completed) and old cells (more than 90% lifespan completed) revealed a progressive increase in population doubling (PD) time, a decrease in attachment frequency, a decrease in the number of S-phase positive cells, a decrease in the rates of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, an increase in the protein content per cell and an increased proportion of senescence-specificβ-galactosidase positive cells. While osteoblastic production of collagen type I decreased progressively during aging, alkaline phosphatase activity dropped rapidly after the first few passages and then remained constant during the rest of the proliferative lifespan. Significant morphological changes from thin and spindle-shaped early passage young cells to large, flattened and irregularly shaped late passage old cells full of intracellular debris were observed. In comparison, osteoblasts established from an osteoporotic bone sample showed a maximum CPDL of less than 5, had a longer PD time and exhibited abnormal senescent morphology. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that human osteoblasts, like several other diploid cell types, have a limited proliferative capacity in vitro and undergo aging and senescence as measured by various cellular and biochemical markers. In addition, preliminary studies show that cells from osteoporotic bone have a severely reduced proliferative capacity. This model of bone cell aging facilitates study of the molecular mechanisms of osteoblast senescence as well as factors related to osteoblast dysfunction in patients with osteoporosis.},

	Abstract = {The finite in vitro lifetime of cultured normal cells is interpreted to be aging at the cellular level. In addition to the inverse relationship between donor age and population doubling potential (PDP), a number of biochemical and physiological increments and decrements occur prior to the cessation of cell division. The reconstruction of replicating normal human cells from the nuclei of "young" cells and the cytoplasm of "old" cells (and the reverse) suggests that the nucleus governs PDP. Several morphological changes were found to occur in late phase III cells held for up to one year in culture. Autoradiography studies show that (1) a cell population may be composed of several subpopulations, each of which is at a different stage in its life history and (2) lipid synthesis is affected much less as cells age than is DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Changes occurring in the genetic program of individual cells seem to be the most tenable hypothesis to explain fundamental causes of aging.},

@article{Hayflick1965,
	Abstract = {The time at which human diploid cell strains can be expected to cease dividing in vitro (Phase III) is not a function of the number of subcultivations but rather of the number of potential cell doublings. Each clonable cell within the population is endowed with the same doubling potential (50 ?10). Cells of the same strain, but with different "doubling potentials", were mixed. Phase III in such mixed populations occurs at that time when the "youngest" cell component is expected to reach Phase III. The "older" component has no effect on the time at which Phase III is expected to take place in the "younger" component. An ancillary conclusion that Phase III cannot be explained by the presence of a latent virus, mycoplasma or media composition is confirmed. Human diploid cell strains derived from adult lung have a significantly lower doubling potential in vitro than do fetal strains. The Phase III phenomenon may be related to senescence in vivo. The cellular theory of aging must be related to normal cells in vitro and not to heteroploid cell lines. The former have a finite period of multiplication; the latter are indefinitely cultivable. In vivo experiments also indicate that transplanted normal tissue has a finite lifetime. Chromosome anomalies occurring in Phase III may be related to such anomalies occurring in the cells of older animals, including man. The survival curves obtained with human diploid cell strains are comparable to "multiple-hit" or "multiple-target" curves obtained with other biological systems where an initial threshold dose is required before an exponential form of the curve is established. Whatever cell component(s) may be involved in the finite lifetime of human diploid cell strains, the ultimate accumulation of nondividing cells could be the result of accumulated damage to a single cellular target or to inactivation of many targets.},

	Abstract = {The following Master's thesis presents three Finite State Projection-based parameter estimation algorithms for inference of stochastic chemical kinetic rate constants. The underlying systems are assumed to be governed by the chemical master equation, and the experimental data is supposed to originate from high-throughput measurements, for example flow cytometry and relatives. Presented are an optimization-based algorithm to match probability densities, a maximum likelihood algorithm and a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based algorithm. Several specific algorithm settings are varied to assess their influence on the parameter estimates. It is found that the maximum likelihood method yields more accurate results than the optimization-based algorithm, and that the Markov chain Monte carlo based algorithm is able to yield the full joint distribution of the estimated parameters to allow further investigation.},

relevant statistical hypotheses on the probable difference between two means, the importance of the Behrens-
Fisher problem from a theoretical perspective is acknowledged, but it is concluded that this problem is
irrelevant for applied research in psychology, education, and related disciplines. The focus is better placed on
``shift in location'' and, more importantly, ``shift in location and change in scale'' treatment alternatives.},

	Abstract = {Immunological synapse formation is usually assumed to require antigen recognition by T cell receptors. However, the immunological synapse formed at the interface between na{\"\i}ve T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) has never been described. We show here that in the absence of antigen, and even of major histocompatibility complex molecules, T cell−DC synapses are formed and lead to several T cell responses: a local increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, small Ca2+ responses, weak proliferation and long-term survival. These responses are triggered more readily in CD4+ T cells than in CD8+ T cells, which express a specific isoform of the repulsive molecule CD43. These phenomena may play a major role in the maintenance of the na{\"\i}ve T cell pool in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The basic topic of this book is solving problems from system and control theory using convex optimization. We show that a wide variety of problems arising in system and control theory can be reduced to a handful of standard convex and quasiconvex optimization problems that involve matrix inequalities. For a few special cases there are \analytic solutions" to these problems, but our main point is that they can be solved numerically in all cases. These standard problems can be solved in polynomial-time (by, e.g., the ellipsoid algorithm of Shor, Nemirovskii, and Yudin), and so are tractable, at least in a theoretical sense. Recently developed interior-point methods for these standard problems have been found to be extremely efficient in practice. Therefore, we consider the original problems from system and control theory as solved. This book is primarily intended for the researcher in system and control theory, but can also serve as a source of application problems for researchers in convex optimization. Although we believe that the methods described in this book have great practical value, we should warn the reader whose primary interest is applied control engineering. This is a research monograph: We present no specific examples or numerical results, and we make only brief comments about the implications of the results for practical control engineering. To put it in a more positive light, we hope that this book will later be considered as the ¯rst book on the topic, not the most readable or accessible.

The background required of the reader is knowledge of basic system and control theory and an exposure to optimization. Sontag's book Mathematical Control Theory [Son90] is an excellent survey. Further background material is covered in the texts Linear Systems [Kai80] by Kailath, Nonlinear Systems Analysis [Vid92] by Vidyasagar, Optimal Control: Linear Quadratic Methods [AM90] by Anderson and Moore, and Convex Analysis and Minimization Algorithms I [HUL93] by Hiriart-Urruty and Lemarechal.

We also highly recommend the book Interior-point Polynomial Algorithms in Convex Programming [NN94] by Nesterov and Nemirovskii as a companion to this book. The reader will soon see that their ideas and methods play a critical role in the basic idea presented in this book.},

	Abstract = {Background
Dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-neurons are commonly characterized immunocytochemically. Cells are mostly grouped by the experimenter's eye as "marker-positive" and "marker-negative" according to their immunofluorescence intensity. Classification criteria remain largely undefined. Overcoming this shortfall, we established a quantitative automated microscopy (QuAM) for a defined and multiparametric analysis of adherent heterogeneous primary neurons on a single cell base.
The growth factors NGF, GDNF and EGF activate the MAP-kinase Erk1/2 via receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. NGF and GDNF are established factors in regeneration and sensitization of nociceptive neurons. If also the tissue regenerating growth factor, EGF, influences nociceptors is so far unknown. We asked, if EGF can act on nociceptors, and if QuAM can elucidate differences between NGF, GDNF and EGF induced Erk1/2 activation kinetics. Finally, we evaluated, if the investigation of one signalling component allows prediction of the behavioral response to a reagent not tested on nociceptors such as EGF.

Results
We established a software-based neuron identification, described quantitatively DRG-neuron heterogeneity and correlated measured sample sizes and corresponding assay sensitivity. Analysing more than 70,000 individual neurons we defined neuronal subgroups based on differential Erk1/2 activation status in sensory neurons. Baseline activity levels varied strongly already in untreated neurons. NGF and GDNF subgroup responsiveness correlated with their subgroup specificity on IB4(+)- and IB4(-)-neurons, respectively. We confirmed expression of EGF-receptors in all sensory neurons. EGF treatment induced STAT3 translocation into the nucleus. Nevertheless, we could not detect any EGF induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Accordingly, intradermal injection of EGF resulted in a fundamentally different outcome than NGF/GDNF. EGF did not induce mechanical hyperalgesia, but blocked PGE2-induced sensitization.

Conclusions
QuAM is a suitable if not necessary tool to analyze activation of endogenous signalling in heterogeneous cultures. NGF, GDNF and EGF stimulation of DRG-neurons shows differential Erk1/2 activation responses and a corresponding differential behavioral phenotype. Thus, in addition to expression-markers also signalling-activity can be taken for functional subgroup differentiation and as predictor of behavioral outcome. The anti-nociceptive function of EGF is an intriguing result in the context of tissue damage but also for understanding pain resulting from EGF-receptor block during cancer therapy.},

@article{MunskyKha2008,
	Abstract = {In order to capture important subcellular dynamics, researchers in computational biology have begun to turn to mesoscopic models in which molecular interactions at the gene level behave as discrete stochastic events. While the trajectories of such models cannot be described with deterministic expressions, the probability distributions of these trajectories can be described by the set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Until recently, it has been believed that the CME could only be solved analytically in the most trivial of problems, and the CME has been analyzed almost exclusively with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms. However, concepts from linear systems theory have enabled the finite state projection (FSP) approach and have significantly enhanced our ability to solve the CME without resorting to KMC simulations. In this paper, we review the FSP approach and introduce a variety of systems-theory-based modifications and enhancements to the FSP algorithm. Notions such as observability, controllability, and minimal realizations enable large reductions and increase efficiency with little to no loss in accuracy. Model reduction techniques based upon linear perturbation theory allow for the systematic projection of multiple time-scale dynamics onto a slowly varying manifold of much smaller dimension. We also present a powerful new reduction approach, in which we perform computations on a small subset of configuration grid points and then interpolate to find the distribution on the full set. The power of the FSP and its various reduction approaches is illustrated on few important models of genetic regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {We address the problem of model order reduction (MOR) of parametrized dynamical systems. Motivated by reduced basis (RB) methods for partial differential equations, we show that some characteristic components can be transferred to model reduction of parametrized linear dynamical systems. We assume an affine parameter dependence of the system components, which allows an offline/online decomposition and is the basis for efficient reduced simulation. Additionally, error control is possible by a posteriori error estimators for the state vector and output vector, based on residual analysis and primal-dual techniques. Experiments demonstrate the applicability of the reduced parametrized systems, the reliability of the error estimators and the runtime gain by the reduction technique. The a posteriori error estimation technique can straightforwardly be applied to all traditional projection-based reduction techniques of non-parametric and parametric linear systems, such as model reduction, balanced truncation, moment matching, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and so on.},

	Abstract = {Owing to the inherently random and discrete nature of genes, RNAs and proteins within living cells, there can be a wide range of variability both over time in a single cell and from cell to cell in a population of genetically identical cells. Different mechanisms and reaction rates help shape this variability in different ways, and the resulting cell-to-cell variability can be quantitatively measured using techniques such as time-lapse microscopy and fluorescence activated cell sorting (or flow cytometry). It has been shown that these measurements can help to constrain the parameters and mechanisms of stochastic gene regulatory models. In this work, finite state projection approaches are used to explore the possibility of identifying the parameters of a specific stochastic model for the genetic toggle switch consisting of mutually inhibiting proteins: LacI and $\lambda$cI. This article explores the possibility of identifying the model parameters from different types of statistical information, such as mean expression levels, LacI protein distributions and LacI-$\lambda$cI multivariate distributions. It is determined that although the toggle model parameters cannot be uniquely identified from measurements that track just the LacI variability, the parameters could be identified from measurements of the cell-to-cell variability in both regulatory proteins. Based upon the simulated data and the computational investigations of this study, experiments are proposed that could enable this identification.},

The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.},

	Abstract = {The outcome of Ag exposure is dictated by complex regulation of T cell proliferation. The rates of proliferation and survival are altered by numerous signals that the cell receives and integrates to achieve a net response. We have illustrated previously how small changes in kinetic parameters can lead to large differences, even under conditions of saturating IL-2. In this study, we examine the effect of varying IL-2 concentration on T cell response and develop a model incorporating additional parameters of proliferation and survival. Strikingly, the proportion of cells that enter the first division, but not the time at which they enter, is dramatically altered by IL-2. Furthermore, the survival and average division time of cells in later divisions are also altered by IL-2 concentration. Together, the small simultaneous effects on these parameters result in large differences in total cell number. These results reveal how in vitro systems may exaggerate the contribution of IL-2, and thus how costimuli or additional helper cells that alter IL-2 concentration, even by relatively small amounts, will generate large in vitro differences in cell number and therefore appear obligatory. Furthermore, they illustrate how a quantitative model of T cell activation can clarify how complex signal integration is handled by T cells in situ, and therefore more appropriately aid development of a theory of behavior.},

@article{GlaucheHer2010,
	Abstract = {The expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog is commonly associated with pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, recent observations suggest that ES cell populations are heterogeneous with respect to the expression of Nanog and that individual ES cells reversibly change their Nanog expression level. Furthermore, it has been shown that cells exhibiting a low Nanog level are more likely to undergo differentiation. Applying a novel mathematical transcription factor network model we explore mechanisms and feedback regulations to describe the observed variation of the Nanog levels in mouse ES cells. In particular we show that these variations can occur under different assumptions yielding similar experimental characteristics. Based on model predictions we propose experimental strategies to distinguish between these explanations. Concluding from our results we argue that the heterogeneity with respect to the Nanog concentrations is most likely a functional element to control the differentiation propensity of an ES cell population. Furthermore, we provide a conceptual framework that consistently explains Nanog variability and a potential ``gate-keeper'' function of Nanog expression with respect to the control of ES cell differentiation.

	Abstract = {The division tracking dye, carboxyfluorescin diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) is currently the most informative labeling technique for characterizing the division history of cells in the immune system. Gett and Hodgkin [Nat. Immunol. 1:239--244, 2000] have pioneered the quantitative analysis of CFSE data. We confirm and extend their data analysis approach using simple mathematical models. We employ the extended Gett and Hodgkin [Nat. Immunol. 1:239--244, 2000] method to estimate the time to first division, the fraction of cells recruited into division, the cell cycle time, and the average death rate from CFSE data on T cells stimulated under different concentrations of IL-2. The same data is also fitted with a simple mathematical model that we derived by reformulating the numerical model of Deenick et al. [J. Immunol. 170:4963--4972, 2003]. By a non-linear fitting procedure we estimate parameter values and confidence intervals to identify the parameters that are influenced by the IL-2 concentration. We obtain a significantly better fit to the data when we assume that the T cell death rate depends on the number of divisions cells have completed. We provide an outlook on future work that involves extending the Deenick et al. [J. Immunol. 170:4963--4972, 2003] model into the classical smith-martin model, and into a model with arbitrary probability distributions for death and division through subsequent divisions.},

	Abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an inherently noisy process. The origins of this stochastic behavior can be traced to the random transitions among the discrete chemical states of operators that control the transcription rate and to finite number fluctuations in the biochemical reactions for the synthesis and degradation of transcripts. We develop stochastic models to which these random reactions are intrinsic and a series of simpler models derived explicitly from the first as approximations in different parameter regimes. This innate stochasticity can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the behavior of gene-regulatory networks. We introduce a natural generalization of deterministic bifurcations for classification of stochastic systems and show that simple noisy genetic switches have rich bifurcation structures; among them, bifurcations driven solely by changing the rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. We find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice-versa. We derive and solve equations for the mean waiting times for spontaneous transitions between quasistable states in these switches.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian estimation for nonlinear systems is still a challenging problem, as in general the type of the true probability density changes and the complexity increases over time. Hence, approximations of the occurring equations and/or of the underlying probability density functions are inevitable. In this paper, we propose an approximation of the conditional densities by wavelet expansions. This kind of representation allows a sparse set of characterizing coefficients, especially for smooth or piecewise smooth density functions. Besides its good approximation properties, fast algorithms operating on sparse vectors are applicable and thus, a good trade-off between approximation quality and run-time can be achieved. Moreover, due to its highly generic nature, it can be applied to a large class of nonlinear systems with a high modeling accuracy. In particular, the noise acting upon the system can be modeled by an arbitrary probability distribution and can influence the system in any way.},

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) in its various implementations has been proposed as a parameter estimator by several authors. However, in many cases, and in particular when the estimation problem involves a large number of unknown parameters, the EKF can perform poorly.

Such equations arise from the control parametrization of nonlinear control systems, and the computation of reachable sets for such systems is central to many control and verification problems. The method presented computes convex and concave relaxations of the ODE solutions with respect to the parameters, which are then used to compute a convex enclosure of the reachable set. This enclosure is expressed as an infinite intersection of halfspaces, so that a convex polyhedral enclosure of the reachable set can be computed by considering any finite m of these halfspaces. The method requires the solution of m dynamic optimization problems which are guaranteed to be convex, even when the reachable set is itself nonconvex.},

	Abstract = {Switching between two modes of operation is a common property of biological systems. In continuous-time differential equation models, this is often realised by bistability, i.e. the existence of two asymptotically stable steadystates. Several biological models are shown to exhibit delayed switching, with a pronounced transient phase, in particular for near-threshold perturbations. This study shows that this delay in switching from one mode to the other in response to a transient input is reflected in local properties of an unstable saddle point, which has a one dimensional unstable manifold with a significantly slower eigenvalue than the stable ones. Thus, the trajectories first approximatively converge to the saddle point, then linger along the saddle's unstable manifold before quickly approaching one of the stable equilibria.},

	Abstract = {A central challenge in computational modeling of biological systems is the determination of the model parameters. Typically, only a fraction of the parameters (such as kinetic rate constants) are experimentally measured, while the rest are often fitted. The fitting process is usually based on experimental time course measurements of observables, which are used to assign parameter values that minimize some measure of the error between these measurements and the corresponding model prediction. The measurements, which can come from immunoblotting assays, fluorescent markers, etc., tend to be very noisy and taken at a limited number of time points. In this work we present a new approach to the problem of parameter selection of biological models. We show how one can use a dynamic recursive estimator, known as extended Kalman filter, to arrive at estimates of the model parameters. The proposed method follows. First, we use a variation of the Kalman filter that is particularly well suited to biological applications to obtain a first guess for the unknown parameters. Secondly, we employ an a posteriori identifiability test to check the reliability of the estimates. Finally, we solve an optimization problem to refine the first guess in case it should not be accurate enough. The final estimates are guaranteed to be statistically consistent with the measurements. Furthermore, we show how the same tools can be used to discriminate among alternate models of the same biological process. We demonstrate these ideas by applying our methods to two examples, namely a model of the heat shock response in E. coli, and a model of a synthetic gene regulation system. The methods presented are quite general and may be applied to a wide class of biological systems where noisy measurements are used for parameter estimation or model selection.},

	Abstract = {The kinetics of label uptake and dilution in dividing stem cells, e.g., using Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a labeling substance, are a common way to assess the cellular turnover of all hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. The assumption that HSCs form a homogeneous population of cells which regularly undergo cell division has recently been challenged by new experimental results. For a consistent functional explanation of heterogeneity among HSCs, we propose a concept in which stem cells flexibly and reversibly adapt their cycling state according to systemic needs. Applying a mathematical model analysis, we demonstrate that different experimentally observed label dilution kinetics are consistently explained by the proposed model. The dynamically stabilized equilibrium between quiescent and activated cells leads to a biphasic label dilution kinetic in which an initial and pronounced decline of label retaining cells is attributed to faster turnover of activated cells, whereas a secondary, decelerated decline results from the slow turnover of quiescent cells. These results, which support our previous model prediction of a reversible activation/deactivation of HSCs, are also consistent with recent findings that use GFP-conjugated histones as a label instead of BrdU. Based on our findings we interpret HSC organization as an adaptive and regulated process in which the slow activation of quiescent cells and their possible return into quiescence after division are sufficient to explain the simultaneous occurrence of self-renewal and differentiation. Furthermore, we suggest an experimental strategy which is suited to demonstrate that the repopulation ability among the population of label retaining cells changes during the course of dilution.

	Abstract = {Chemotherapy and radiotherapy commonly damage DNA and trigger p53-dependent apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Two unfortunate consequences of this mechanism are resistance due to blockade of p53 or intrinsic apoptosis pathways, and mutagenesis of non-malignant surviving cells which can impair cellular function or provoke second malignancies. Death ligand-based drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), stimulate extrinsic apoptotic signaling, and may overcome resistance to treatments that induce intrinsic apoptosis. As death receptor ligation does not damage DNA as a primary mechanism of pro-apoptotic action, we hypothesized that surviving cells would remain genetically unscathed, suggesting that death ligand-based therapies may avoid some of the adverse effects associated with traditional cancer treatments. Surprisingly, however, treatment with sub-lethal concentrations of TRAIL or FasL was mutagenic. Mutations arose in viable cells that contained active caspases, and overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor crmA or silencing of caspase-8 abolished TRAIL-mediated mutagenesis. Downregulation of the apoptotic nuclease caspase-activated DNAse (CAD)/DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) prevented the DNA damage associated with TRAIL treatment. Although death ligands do not need to damage DNA in order to induce apoptosis, surviving cells nevertheless incur DNA damage after treatment with these agents.},

	Abstract = {The formulation of a mathematical theory of a cell population requires the ability to specify quantitatively the physiological state of individual cells of the population. In procaryotic cells (bacteria and blue-green algae), the intracellular structure is of a relatively simple nature, and it is postulated that the physiological state of such a cell is specified by its biochemical composition. If we postulate further that the growth rate of a cell and its fission probability depend only on the cell's current physiological state and on the current state of the cell's environment, then an equation of change for the distribution of physiological states in a population can be derived. In addition, an equation of change for the state of the cellular environment can be obtained. These equations allow us to predict the statistical and dynamical behavior of a cell population from information obtained by analysis of cellular and subcellular structure and function.},

	Abstract = {Background
In many applications, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are subject to uncertainty or variability in initial conditions and parameters. Both, uncertainty and variability can be quantified in terms of a probability density function on the state and parameter space.

Results
The partial differential equation that describes the evolution of this probability density function has a form that is particularly amenable to application of the well-known method of characteristics. The value of the density at some point in time is directly accessible by the solution of the original ODE extended by a single extra dimension (for the value of the density). This leads to simple methods for studying uncertainty, variability and likelihood, with significant advantages over more traditional Monte Carlo and related approaches especially when studying regions with low probability.

Conclusions
While such approaches based on the method of characteristics are common practice in other disciplines, their advantages for the study of biological systems have so far remained unrecognized. Several examples illustrate performance and accuracy of the approach and its limitations.},

	Abstract = {Background: Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a ``typical cell''. However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.

Results: In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.

Conclusions: The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.},

	Abstract = {In the last years, improved measurement devices, automated data generation, and high-throughput methods have initiated a trend to increasingly precise, but also increasingly complex models. Simulating these high-dimensional models and understanding their basic dynamic properties are crucial challenges encountered right now. One way towards these goals is model reduction. In this paper, we propose a trajectory-based method for reducing the input-output (I/O) map of continuous-time nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The method uses a sample of simulated I/O-trajectories, obtained by distributing initial states and input trajectories according to a probability density. Employing Monte-Carlo integration and the observability normal form, parameters of a reduced model are determined by convex optimization from this sample of trajectories. The properties of the method are illustrated using a model of the MAPK cascade. It is shown that redundancies are detected and that the approach can deal with nonlinear dynamics, such as limit-cycle oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems can show a variety of different qualitative behaviors depending on the actual parameter values. As in many situations of practical relevance the parameter values are not precisely known it is crucial to determine the region in parameter space where the system exhibits the desired behavior. In this paper we propose a method to compute an approximative, analytical description of this region. Employing Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampling, nonlinear support vector machines, and the novel notion of margin functions, an approximative classification function is determined. The properties of the method are illustrated by studying the dynamic behavior of the Higgins-Sel'kov oscillator.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of parameter estimation for intracellular network models with statistical Bayesian approaches. We use systems of nonlinear differential equations in order to describe the dynamics of those networks. In this setting, the posterior distribution has to be investigated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. An estimation of summary statistics of the posterior from these samples requires appropriate density estimation methods. We focus in this study particularly on the influence of kernel density estimators on the expected information content of the posterior. A new method for the calculation of this information content is introduced that uses directly the unnormalized posterior values at the sample points. We exemplarily show its superiority to kernel estimators on a model of secretory pathway control at the trans-Golgi network in mammalian cells.},

@article{SchittlerHas2010,
	Abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to bone and other tissue cells, but their differentiation still escapes full control. In this paper we address this issue by mathematical modeling. We present a model for a genetic switch determining the cell fate of progenitor cells which can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone cells) or chondrocytes (cartilage cells). The model consists of two switch mechanisms and reproduces the experimentally observed three stable equilibrium states: a progenitor, an osteogenic, and a chondrogenic state. Conventionally, the loss of an intermediate (progenitor) state and the entailed attraction to one of two opposite (differentiated) states is modeled as a result of changing parameters. In our model in contrast, we achieve this by distributing the differentiation process to two functional switch parts acting in concert: one triggering differentiation and the other determining cell fate. Via stability and bifurcation analysis, we investigate the effects of biochemical stimuli associated with different system inputs. We employ our model to generate differentiation scenarios on the single cell as well as on the cell population level. The single cell scenarios allow to reconstruct the switching upon extrinsic signals, whereas the cell population scenarios provide a framework to identify the impact of intrinsic properties and the limiting factors for successful differentiation.},

	Abstract = {The signaling network downstream of the ErbB family of receptors has been extensively targeted by cancer therapeutics; however, understanding the relative importance of the different components of the ErbB network is nontrivial. To explore the optimal way to therapeutically inhibit combinatorial, ligandinduced activation of the ErbB--phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) axis, we built a computational model of the ErbB signaling network that describes the most effective ErbB ligands, as well as known and previously unidentified ErbB inhibitors. Sensitivity analysis identified ErbB3 as the key node in response to ligands that can bind either ErbB3 or EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). We describe MM-121, a human monoclonal antibody that halts the growth of tumor xenografts in mice and, consistent with model-simulated inhibitor data, potently inhibits ErbB3 phosphorylation in a manner distinct from that of other ErbB-targeted therapies. MM-121, a previously unidentified anticancer therapeutic designed using a systems approach, promises to benefit patients with combinatorial, ligand-induced activation of the ErbB signaling network that are not effectively treated by current therapies targeting overexpressed or mutated oncogenes.},

Thus, it will almost certainly be necessary to use new 'targeted' pharmaceuticals in combinations. Multicomponent drugs are standard in cytotoxic chemotherapy, but their development has required arduous empirical testing. However, experimentally validated numerical models should greatly aid in the formulation of new combination therapies, particularly those tailored to the needs of specific patients. This perspective focuses on opportunities and challenges inherent in the application of mathematical modeling and systems approaches to pharmacology, specifically with respect to the idea of achieving combinatorial selectivity through use of multicomponent drugs.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of computing outer bounds for the region of steady states of biochemical reaction networks modelled by ordinary differential equations, with respect to parameters that are allowed to vary within a predefined region. An improved implementation of an algorithm which we presented earlier is developed in order to increase the computational efficiency. The gain in efficiency enables the analysis of medium scale biochemical network models. The applicability of the algorithm to such networks is illustrated by studying a newly developed model for a tumor necrosis factor signalling pathway. This pathway is of major importance for the inflammatory response in mammals and therefore of high biomedical interest. The proposed uncertainty analysis algorithm is applied to the model in order to understand how variations in the parameters and co-stimulation of different receptor types may affect the signalling response in this pathway.},

	Abstract = {ethods for the approximation of large-scale dynamical systems will be surveyed. There are mainly two families namely, the SVD-based and Krylov-based approximation methods. The former family is based on the singular value decomposition and the second on moment matching. While the former has many desirable properties including an error bound, it cannot be applied to systems of high complexity. The strength of the latter on the other hand, is that it can be implemented iteratively and is thus appropriate for application to high complexity systems. An effort to combine the best attributes of these two families leads to a third class of approximation methods, which will be referred to as SVD/Krylov. Following a survey of these methods we will conclude with a new result concerning model reduction with preservation of passivity which is appropriate for application to large-scale circuits arising in VLSI chip performance verification.},

	Abstract = {Many industrial processes belong to distributed parameter systems (DPS) that have strong spatial--temporal dynamics. Modeling of DPS is difficult but essential to simulation, control and optimization. The first-principle modeling for known DPS often leads to the partial differential equation (PDE). Because it is an infinite-dimensional system, the model reduction (MR) is very necessary for real implementation. The model reduction often works with selection of basis functions (BF). Combination of different BF and MR results in different approaches. For unknown DPS, system identification is usually used to figure out unknown structure and parameters. Using various methods, different approaches are developed. Finally, a novel kernel-based approach is proposed for the complex DPS. This paper provides a brief review of different DPS modeling methods and categorizes them from the view of time--space separation.

@article{Branschaedel2010,
	Abstract = {The proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) exists as a homotrimer, capable of binding three receptor molecules. However, signal competent ligand/receptor complexes form large clusters, likely to be stabilized by additional molecular interactions. Both TNF receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, contain four cysteine rich domains (CRD) in their extracellular parts. Previous work showed that the membrane distal CRD1 carries a homophilic interaction domain. Here, we investigated the functional role of CRD1 and its two submodules, A1CRD1 and B2CRD1, in a TNFR1-Fas chimera model system. Removal of CRD1 abolishes TNF binding. In line with these data, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that B2CRD1 of TNFR1 serves as a scaffold to stabilize CRD2 in a conformation necessary for high affinity ligand binding. Deletion of only the N-terminal half of CRD1 (DeltaA1CRD1) of TNFR1 marginally affects ligand binding but abrogates responsiveness towards soluble TNF and reduces effectiveness as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild type TNFR1. A TNFR1-derived molecule containing the CRD1 from TNFR2 also shows reduced responsiveness to soluble TNF. These data strongly suggest that CRD1 is not only crucially involved in multimerization of unligated receptors, but is also directly involved in formation of signal competent ligand/receptor clusters, thereby controlling receptor responsiveness.},

	Abstract = {Death receptors (DRs) can induce apoptosis by oligomerization with TRAIL, whereas death decoy receptors (DcRs) cannot, due to their lack of functional intracellular death domains. However, it is not known whether DRs and DcRs can interact with one another to form oligomeric complexes prior to TRAIL binding. To address this issue, the extracellular domains (ECDs) of DR4 (sDR4), DR5 (sDR5), DcR1 (sDcR1), and DcR2 (sDcR2) were expressed in a soluble, monomeric form, and their binding interactions were quantified by surface plasmon resonance. The purified sDRs and sDcRs exhibited native-like secondary structure and bound to TRAIL with binding affinities in the nanomolar range (KD = 10--62 nM), suggesting that they were properly folded and functional. The soluble receptors interacted homophilically and heterophilically with similar micromolar range affinities (KD = 1--9 μM), with the exception that sDR5 did not interact with the sDcRs. Our results suggest that most DRs and DcRs can laterally interact through their ECDs to form homomeric and/or heteromeric complexes in the absence of TRAIL binding.},

@article{HuberLau2010,
	Abstract = {Background
Apoptosis is an essential cell death process throughout the entire life span of all metazoans and its deregulation in humans has been implicated in many proliferative and degenerative diseases. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) and activation of effector caspases are key processes during apoptosis signalling. MOMP can be subject to spatial coordination in human cancer cells, resulting in intracellular waves of cytochrome-c release. To investigate the consequences of these spatial anisotropies in mitochondrial permeabilisation on subsequent effector caspase activation, we devised a mathematical reaction-diffusion model building on a set of partial differential equations.

Results
Reaction-diffusion modelling suggested that even if strong spatial anisotropies existed during mitochondrial cytochrome c release, these would be eliminated by free diffusion of the cytosolic proteins that instantiate the apoptosis execution network. Experimentally, rapid sampling of mitochondrial permeabilisation and effector caspase activity in individual HeLa cervical cancer cells confirmed predictions of the reaction-diffusion model and demonstrated that the signalling network of apoptosis execution could efficiently translate spatial anisotropies in mitochondrial permeabilisation into a homogeneous effector caspase response throughout the cytosol. Further systems modelling suggested that a more than 10,000-fold impaired diffusivity would be required to maintain spatial anisotropies as observed during mitochondrial permeabilisation until the time effector caspases become activated.

Conclusions
Multi-protein diffusion efficiently contributes to eliminating spatial asynchronies which are present during the initiation of apoptosis execution and thereby ensures homogeneous apoptosis execution throughout the entire cell body. For previously reported biological scenarios in which effector caspase activity was shown to be targeted selectively to specific subcellular regions additional mechanisms must exist that limit or spatially coordinate caspase activation and/or protect diffusing soluble caspase substrates from unwanted proteolysis.},

	Abstract = {FAS (also called APO-1 and CD95) and its physiological ligand, FASL, regulate apoptosis of unwanted or dangerous cells, functioning as a guardian against autoimmunity and cancer development. Distinct cell types differ in the mechanisms by which the `death receptor' FAS triggers their apoptosis. In type I cells, such as lymphocytes, activation of `effector caspases' by FAS-induced activation of caspase-8 suffices for cell killing, whereas in type II cells, including hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells, caspase cascade amplification through caspase-8-mediated activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist)5 is essential. Here we show that loss of XIAP (X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) function by gene targeting or treatment with a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC, also called DIABLO; direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) mimetic drug in mice rendered hepatocytes and β-cells independent of BID for FAS-induced apoptosis. These results show that XIAP is the critical discriminator between type I and type II apoptosis signalling and suggest that IAP inhibitors should be used with caution in cancer patients with underlying liver conditions.},

Oscillations and variability in the p53 system. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2, 2006.0033]. Several models for this system have been proposed by different groups, based essentially on negative feedback loops. In this paper we investigate in detail oscillations and stability in a deterministic time delayed differential model of the core circuit for p53 expression. This model is representative of a class of modelling approaches of this system, based on a "minimal" set of well-established biomolecular regulations. Depending on the protein degradation rates we show the existence of bifurcations between a stable steady state and oscillations both in presence and absence of stress.},

	Abstract = {The importance of cellular senescence, which is a stress response that stably blocks proliferation, is increasingly being recognized. Senescence is prevalent in pre-malignant tumours, and progression to malignancy requires evading senescence. Malignant tumours, however, may still undergo senescence owing to interventions that restore tumour suppressor function or inactivate oncogenes. Senescent tumour cells can be cleared by immune cells, which may result in efficient tumour regression. Standard chemotherapy also has the potential to induce senescence, which may partly underlie its therapeutic activity. Although these concepts are well supported in mouse models, translating them to clinical oncology remains a challenge.},

	Abstract = {The p53 protein is well-known for its tumour suppressor function. The p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop constitutes the core module of a network of regulatory interactions activated under cellular stress. In normal cells, the level of p53 proteins is kept low by MDM2, i.e. MDM2 negatively regulates the activity of p53. In the case of DNA damage,the p53-mediated pathways are activated leading to cell cycle arrest and repair of the DNA. If repair is not possible due to excessive damage, the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway is activated bringing about cell death. In this paper, we give an overview of our studies on the p53-MDM2 module and the associated pathways from a systems biology perspective. We discuss a number of key predictions, related to some specific aspects of cell cycle arrest and cell death, which could be tested in experiments.},

	Abstract = {Simulated annealing---moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions---has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.

	Abstract = {Motivation: Computer simulations have become an important tool across the biomedical sciences and beyond. For many important problems several different models or hypotheses exist and choosing which one best describes reality or observed data is not straightforward. We therefore require suitable statistical tools that allow us to choose rationally between different mechanistic models of, e.g. signal transduction or gene regulation networks. This is particularly challenging in systems biology where only a small number of molecular species can be assayed at any given time and all measurements are subject to measurement uncertainty.

Results: Here, we develop such a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation and employing sequential Monte Carlo sampling. We show that our approach can be applied across a wide range of biological scenarios, and we illustrate its use on real data describing influenza dynamics and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Bayesian model selection strikes a balance between the complexity of the simulation models and their ability to describe observed data. The present approach enables us to employ the whole formal apparatus to any system that can be (efficiently) simulated, even when exact likelihoods are computationally intractable.},

@article{Jamshidi2009,
	Abstract = {Background
A growing number of realistic in silico models of metabolic functions are being formulated and can serve as 'dry lab' platforms to prototype and simulate experiments before they are performed. For example, dual perturbation experiments that vary both genetic and environmental parameters can readily be simulated in silico. Genetic and environmental perturbations were applied to a cell-scale model of the human erythrocyte and subsequently investigated.

Results
The resulting steady state fluxes and concentrations, as well as dynamic responses to the perturbations were analyzed, yielding two important conclusions: 1) that transporters are informative about the internal states (fluxes and concentrations) of a cell and, 2) that genetic variations can disrupt the natural sequence of dynamic interactions between network components. The former arises from adjustments in energy and redox states, while the latter is a result of shifting time scales in aggregate pool formation of metabolites. These two concepts are illustrated for glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in the human red blood cell.

Conclusion
Dual perturbation experiments in silico are much more informative for the characterization of functional states than single perturbations. Predictions from an experimentally validated cellular model of metabolism indicate that the measurement of cofactor precursor transport rates can inform the internal state of the cell when the external demands are altered or a causal genetic variation is introduced. Finally, genetic mutations that alter the clinical phenotype may also disrupt the 'natural' time scale hierarchy of interactions in the network.},

	Abstract = {Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation cascades, such as the mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100% of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian inflammatory signaling, for which NF-$\kappa$B is a principal transcription factor, is an exquisite example of how cellular signaling pathways can be regulated to produce different yet specific responses to different inflammatory insults. Mathematical models, tightly linked to experiment, have been instrumental in unraveling the forms of regulation in NF-$\kappa$B signaling and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Our initial model of the I$\kappa$B--NF-$\kappa$B signaling module highlighted the role of negative feedback in the control of NF-$\kappa$B temporal dynamics and gene expression. Subsequent studies sparked by this work have helped to characterize additional feedback loops, the input--output behavior of the module, crosstalk between multiple NF-$\kappa$B-activating pathways, and NF-$\kappa$B oscillations. We anticipate that computational techniques will enable further progress in the NF-$\kappa$B field, and the signal transduction field in general, and we discuss potential upcoming developments.},

Such population-wide studies mask the behavior of individual cells and are often insufficient for characterizing biological processes in which cellular heterogeneity plays a key role. A unifying theme of many recent studies has been a focus on the development and utilization of single-cell experimental techniques that are capable of probing key biological phenomena in individual living cells. Recently, novel information about gene expression dynamics has been obtained from single-cell experiments that draw upon the unique capabilities of fluorescent reporter proteins.},

	Abstract = {Cellular signal transduction pathways are usually studied following administration of an external stimulus. However, disease-associated aberrant activity of the pathway is often due to misregulation of the equilibrium state. The transcription factor NF-B is typically described as being held inactive in the cytoplasm by binding its inhibitor, IB, until an external stimulus triggers IB degradation through an IB kinase-dependent degradation pathway. Combining genetic, biochemical, and computational tools, we investigate steady-state regulation of the NF-B signaling module and its impact on stimulus responsiveness. We present newly measured in vivo degradation rate constants for NF-B-bound and -unbound IB proteins that are critical for accurate computational predictions of steady-state IB protein levels and basal NF-B activity. Simulations reveal a homeostatic NF-B signaling module in which differential degradation rates of free and bound pools of IB represent a novel cross-regulation mechanism that imparts functional robustness to the signaling module.},

The goal is to improve by an order of magnitude upon the accuracy of the standard intervals $\hat{\theta} \pm z^{(\alpha)} \hat{\sigma}$, in a way that allows routine application even to very complicated problems. Both theory and examples are used to show how this is done. The first seven sections provide a heuristic overview of four bootstrap confidence interval procedures: $BC_a$, bootstrap-t , ABC and calibration. Sections 8 and 9 describe the theory behind these methods, and their close connection with the likelihood-based confidence interval theory developed by Barndorff-Nielsen, Cox and Reid and others.},

	Abstract = {The inherent complexity of cellular signaling networks and their importance to a wide range of cellular functions necessitates the development of modeling methods that can be applied toward making predictions and highlighting the appropriate experiments to test our understanding of how these systems are designed and function. We use methods of statistical mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling networks. A key difficulty with signaling models is that, while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these networks, many of the parameters required to describe their behavior remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. In particular, we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling proteins, each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling approach, we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call `sloppiness.'},

We have developed a computer simulation of EGF-induced MAPK cascade activation, which provides quantitative evidence that feedback inhibition of the MAPK cascade is the most important factor in determining the duration of cascade activation. Hence, we propose that the observed quantitative differences in EGF and NGF signalling can be accounted for by differential feedback regulation of the MAPK cascade.},

@article{WittBar2009,
	Abstract = {Background
Biological effects of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) can differ tremendously depending on the cellular context. For example, NFκB induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1) is converted from an inhibitor of death receptor induced apoptosis into a promoter of ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB)-induced apoptosis. This conversion requires prolonged NFκB activation and is facilitated by IL-1 + UVB-induced abrogation of the negative feedback loop for NFκB, involving a lack of inhibitor of κB (IκBα) protein reappearance. Permanent activation of the upstream kinase IKKβ results from UVB-induced inhibition of the catalytic subunit of Ser-Thr phosphatase PP2A (PP2Ac), leading to immediate phosphorylation and degradation of newly synthesized IκBα.

Results
To investigate the mechanism underlying the general PP2A-mediated tuning of IKKβ phosphorylation upon IL-1 stimulation, we have developed a strictly reduced mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations which includes the essential processes concerning the IL-1 receptor, IKKβ and PP2A. Combining experimental and modelling approaches we demonstrate that constitutively active, but not post-stimulation activated PP2A, tunes out IKKβ phosphorylation thus allowing for IκBα resynthesis in response to IL-1. Identifiability analysis and determination of confidence intervals reveal that the model allows reliable predictions regarding the dynamics of PP2A deactivation and IKKβ phosphorylation. Additionally, scenario analysis is used to scrutinize several hypotheses regarding the mode of UVB-induced PP2Ac inhibition. The model suggests that down regulation of PP2Ac activity, which results in prevention of IκBα reappearance, is not a direct UVB action but requires instrumentality.

Conclusion
The model developed here can be used as a reliable building block of larger NFκB models and offers comprehensive simplification potential for future modeling of NFκB signaling. It gives more insight into the newly discovered mechanisms for IKK deactivation and allows for substantiated predictions and investigation of different hypotheses. The evidence of constitutive activity of PP2Ac at the IKK complex provides new insights into the feedback regulation of NFκB, which is crucial for the development of new anti-cancer strategies.},

	Abstract = {Insulin and other hormones control target cells through a network of signal-mediating molecules. Such networks are extremely complex due to multiple feedback loops in combination with redundancy, shared signal mediators, and cross-talk between signal pathways. We present a novel framework that integrates experimental work and mathematical modeling to quantitatively characterize the role and relation between co-existing submechanisms in complex signaling networks. The approach is independent of knowing or uniquely estimating model parameters because it only relies on (i) rejections and (ii) core predictions (uniquely identified properties in unidentifiable models). The power of our approach is demonstrated through numerous iterations between experiments, model-based data analyses, and theoretical predictions to characterize the relative role of co-existing feedbacks governing insulin signaling. We examined phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 and endocytosis of the receptor in response to various different experimental perturbations in primary human adipocytes. The analysis revealed that receptor endocytosis is necessary for two identified feedback mechanisms involving mass and information transfer, respectively. Experimental findings indicate that interfering with the feedback may substantially increase overall signaling strength, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Because the central observations are present in other signaling networks, our results may indicate a general mechanism in hormonal control.},

	Abstract = {Biological measurements of intracellular regulation processes are typically noisy, and time resolution is low. In practice often only steady state measurements of perturbation experiments are available. Since data acquisition is expensive, a framework for experimental design that allows the inclusion of prior knowledge and takes uncertainty into account is highly desirable. We introduce a framework for the experimental design problem to infer parameters from steady state observations of intracellular networks. Our network model consists of (nonlinear) ordinary differential equations based on chemical reaction kinetics. We consider sets of structural perturbation experiments, that is, steady state measurements of the system subject to gene knockout or mutations. The model is stochastically embedded by introducing Gaussian measurement errors. This allows the application of a statistical Bayesian framework and usage of information-theoretic measures for experimental design. We propose to choose the optimal experiments with respect to identifiability of model parameters by maximizing the information content of the expected outcome, measured as the entropy of the posterior distributions. In this setting the posterior has no closed form and an analysis requires efficient sampling methods. We introduce a simulation-based experimental design framework for the identification of network parameters with an efficient entropy estimation approach. First results are shown on a network model for secretory pathway control. Secretion of proteins from cells involves the budding of vesicles at the Golgi. For this process PKD activity is central.},

	Abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods can be used to evaluate posterior distributions without having to calculate likelihoods. In this paper, we discuss and apply an ABC method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate parameters of dynamical models. We show that ABC SMC provides information about the inferability of parameters and model sensitivity to changes in parameters, and tends to perform better than other ABC approaches. The algorithm is applied to several well-known biological systems, for which parameters and their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},

	Abstract = {The problem of finding the most interesting low dimensional subspaces of a multidimensional data set has usually been formulated as a search for the maximum over all projection subspaces of a measure of information. Alternatively, interesting subspaces may be characterized as the eigenspaces associated to the largest eigenvalues of a tensor valued information measure on the whole space. Since this same information measure solves the problem of the asymptotically optimal multivariate histogram, the issues of selection and representation are resolved simultaneously. This leads to substantial simplification of both the computational and conceptual problems in projection pursuit.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new method for estimating parameters in non-linear differential equations. These models represent change in a system by linking the behavior of a derivative of a process to the behavior of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to statistical techniques such as inference and interval estimation. This paper describes a new method that uses noisy data to estimate the parameters defining a system of nonlinear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive interval estimates and show that these have good coverage properties on data simulated from chemical engineering and neurobiology. The method is demonstrated using real-world data from chemistry and from the progress of the auto-immune disease lupus.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: We have used state-space models to reverse engineer transcriptional networks from highly replicated gene expression profiling time series data obtained from a well-established model of T cell activation. State-space models are a class of dynamic Bayesian networks in which the observed measurements depend on some hidden state variables that evolve according to Markovian dynamics. These hidden variables can capture effects which cannot be directly measured in a gene expression profiling experiment, for example: genes that have not been included in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, the effects of mRNA and protein degradation etc.

Results: We have approached the problem of inferring the model structure of these state-space models using both classical and Bayesian methods. In our previous work, a bootstrap procedure was used to derive classical confidence intervals for parameters representing `gene-gene' interactions over time. In this paper variational approximations are used to perform the analogous model selection task in the Bayesian context. Certain interactions are present in both the classical and the Bayesian analyses of these regulatory networks. The resulting models place JunB and JunD at the centre of the mechanisms that control apoptosis and proliferation. These mechanisms are key for clonal expansion and for controlling the long term behavior (e.g. programmed cell death) of these cells.

	Abstract = {Motivation: In systems like Escherichia Coli, the abundance of sequence information, gene expression array studies and small scale experiments allows one to reconstruct the regulatory network and to quantify the effects of transcription factors on gene expression. However, this goal can only be achieved if all information sources are used in concert.

Results: Our method integrates literature information, DNA sequences and expression arrays. A set of relevant transcription factors is defined on the basis of literature. Sequence data are used to identify potential target genes and the results are used to define a prior distribution on the topology of the regulatory network. A Bayesian hidden component model for the expression array data allows us to identify which of the potential binding sites are actually used by the regulatory proteins in the studied cell conditions, the strength of their control, and their activation profile in a series of experiments. We apply our methodology to 35 expression studies in E.Coli with convincing results.

	Abstract = {Background
High-quality quantitative data is a major limitation in systems biology. The experimental data used in systems biology can be assigned to one of the following categories: assays yielding average data of a cell population, high-content single cell measurements and high-throughput techniques generating single cell data for large cell populations. For modeling purposes, a combination of data from different categories is highly desirable in order to increase the number of observable species and processes and thereby maximize the identifiability of parameters.

Results
In this article we present a method that combines the power of high-content single cell measurements with the efficiency of high-throughput techniques. A calibration on the basis of identical cell populations measured by both approaches connects the two techniques. We develop a mathematical model to relate quantities exclusively observable by high-content single cell techniques to those measurable with high-content as well as high-throughput methods. The latter are defined as free variables, while the variables measurable with only one technique are described in dependence of those. It is the combination of data calibration and model into a single method that makes it possible to determine quantities only accessible by single cell assays but using high-throughput techniques. As an example, we apply our approach to the nucleocytoplasmic transport of STAT5B in eukaryotic cells.

Conclusions
The presented procedure can be generally applied to systems that allow for dividing observables into sets of free quantities, which are easily measurable, and variables dependent on those. Hence, it extends the information content of high-throughput methods by incorporating data from high-content measurements.},

	Abstract = {Background
Cellular transformations which involve a significant phenotypical change of the cell's state use bistable biochemical switches as underlying decision systems. Some of these transformations act over a very long time scale on the cell population level, up to the entire lifespan of the organism.

Results
In this work, we aim at linking cellular decisions taking place on a time scale of years to decades with the biochemical dynamics in signal transduction and gene regulation, occuring on a time scale of minutes to hours. We show that a stochastic bistable switch forms a viable biochemical mechanism to implement decision processes on long time scales. As a case study, the mechanism is applied to model the initiation of follicle growth in mammalian ovaries, where the physiological time scale of follicle pool depletion is on the order of the organism's lifespan. We construct a simple mathematical model for this process based on experimental evidence for the involved genetic mechanisms.

Conclusions
Despite the underlying stochasticity, the proposed mechanism turns out to yield reliable behavior in large populations of cells subject to the considered decision process. Our model explains how the physiological time constant may emerge from the intrinsic stochasticity of the underlying gene regulatory network. Apart from ovarian follicles, the proposed mechanism may also be of relevance for other physiological systems where cells take binary decisions over a long time scale.},

However, many mathematical statistics textbooks, particularly those at the Senior/Masters level, do not give this important topic coverage commensurate with its place in the world of modern applications. Similarly, in nonlinear estimation problems, standard practice (as reflected by procedures available in the popular commercial statistical packages) has been slow to recognize the advantages of likelihood-based confidence regions/intervals over the commonly use "normal-theory" regions/intervals based on the asymptotic distribution of the "Wald statistic."

	Abstract = {The notion of identifiability addresses the question of whether it is at all possible to obtain unique solutions for unknown parameters of interest in a mathematical model, from data collected in well-defined stimulus-response experiments performed on a dynamic system represented by the model. This critical aspect of the modeling and data reduction problem is reviewed, analyzed, and unified, with emphasis on applications in biology. Several physiological system models are examined in detail. They illustrate the importance of identifiability analysis prior to performing a parameter estimation experiment, the algebraic difficulties, possible pitfalls, and not-so-apparent ambiguities that may be encountered--even for simple models--and the utility of the concept in experiment design. Methods for testing for identifiability also are reviewed and compared, with emphasis on applicability and limitations. The usefulness of a given model for predicting the time course of system variables (not parameters) of interest normally inaccessible to direct measurement (e.g., tissue concentrations), a common use for quantitative models, is shown to depend intimately on the identifiability properties of the model, in a manner not easy but essential to assess: state variable predictions made in this manner can be inherently ambiguous. },

In this expansion the score function and the Fisher information are replaced by the efficient score function and efficient Fisher information. The expansion may be used, among others, to prove the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, to derive the asymptotic chi-squared distribution of the log-likelihood ratio statistic, and to prove the consistency of the observed information as an estimator of the inverse of the asymptotic variance.},

	Abstract = {Analysis and safety considerations of chemical and biological processes require complete knowledge of the set of all feasible steady states. Nonlinearities, uncertain parameters, and discrete variables complicate the task of obtaining this set. In this paper, the problem of outer-approximating the region of feasible steady states, for processes described by uncertain nonlinear differential algebraic equations including discrete variables and discrete changes in the dynamics, is addressed.

The calculation of the outer bounds is based on a relaxed version of the corresponding feasibility problem. It uses the Lagrange dual problem to obtain certificates for regions in state space not containing steady states. These infeasibility certificates can be computed efficiently by solving a semidefinite program, rendering the calculation of an outer bounding set computationally feasible. The derived method guarantees globally valid outer bounds for the feasible steady states.

The method is exemplified by the analysis of a simple chemical reactor showing parametric uncertainties and large variability due to the appearance of bifurcations characterising the ignition and extinction of a reaction.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of model-based experimental design is to maximise the information gathered for quantitative model identification. Instead of the commonly used optimal experimental design, robust experimental design aims to address parametric uncertainties in the design process. In this paper, the Bayesian robust experimental design is investigated, where both a Monte Carlo sampling strategy and local sensitivity evaluation at each sampling point are employed to achieve the robust solution. The link between global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and the Bayesian robust experimental design is established. It is revealed that a lattice sampling based GSA strategy, the Morris method, can be explicitly interpreted as the Bayesian A-optimal design for the uniform hypercube type uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models of particulate processes usually include a population balance equation to describe the dynamics of the size distribution. The structure of the population balance equation is the same in all models of particulate processes and the specific physical and chemical interaction of the particles is described by individual kernels. Usually first principles modeling is used to develop the kernels, but in cases in which this is intractable, inverse problem techniques have been proposed in the literature to extract the kernels from experimental data. In this work we introduce an approach that can be used for extracting the growth kernel. This approach is applicable even when the assumption of separable growth rate that has been made in previous approaches does not hold and when coagulation with known dynamics and growth are taking place simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {The increase in complexity in process control goes along with an increasing need for complete and guaranteed fault diagnosis. In this contribution, we propose a set-based method for complete fault diagnosis for polynomial systems. It is based on a reformulation of the diagnosis problem as a nonlinear feasibility problem, which is subsequently relaxed into a semidefinite program. This is done by exploiting the polynomial/rational structure of the discrete-time model equations. We assume the measurements of the output and the input to be available as uncertain, but bounded convex sets. The applicability of the method is demonstrated considering a two-tank system subject to multiple faults.},

	Abstract = {In the area of systems biology, dynamical models of biochemical reaction networks are used to derive model-based predictions about the related biological processes. This thesis provides new methods to study how parametric uncertainty affects such predictions. The focus of this study is on predictions about the steady states and the type of dynamical behaviour, such as bistability or oscillations.

Concerning steady states, the problem of uncertainty analysis is investigated. For a given extent of parametric uncertainty, the objective is to compute bounds on the variations in the steady states. In view of an underlying feasibility problem, a method based on semidefinite programming is developed to solve this problem. The approach is also applied to compute a measure for the robustness of the location of steady states in the presence of parametric uncertainty.

Regarding the effect of parametric uncertainty on the type of dynamical behaviour, the robustness problem is considered. A robustness measure is defined by the extent of parametric uncertainty for which no local bifurcations occur. An approach to solve the robustness problem with frequency domain methods is investigated. The proposed feedback loop breaking method allows to characterise parametric uncertainties for which the type of dynamical behaviour is robust. On the one hand, a lower bound on the corresponding robustness measure is computed by providing Positivstellensatz infeasibility certificates for the underlying equations. On the other hand, the feedback loop breaking concept is adopted for the design of a bifurcation search algorithm in a high-dimensional parameter space. The results of the search algorithm thereby provide an upper bound on the robustness measure.

In addition, the novel concept of kinetic perturbations is introduced. This is a class of specific parametric uncertainties which are particularly useful for the analysis of biochemical reaction networks. It is shown that a robustness analysis is performed efficiently for kinetic perturbations by use of the structured singular value. As a side result, the direct relation between kinetic perturbations and changes to the sensitivity of steady states in a biochemical reaction network is demonstrated.

To complement the methodological results, a novel model for a specific biochemical signal transduction system within the TNF induced signalling network is constructed. The model is analysed with methods developed in this thesis. In addition to an illustrative application of the new methods, the findings of this analysis also provide new biological insight into TNF signal transduction.},

	Abstract = {The cell differentiation process corresponds to a loss of multipotency and increasing specialization. This can be viewed as a sequence of cell fate decisions, each represented by a genetic switch. In this work we focus on one such decision step in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts. We develop a model for the "osteo-chondro switch", i.e. the differentiation of osteo-chondro progenitors into either osteoblasts or chondrocytes.

For this genetic switch, a set of key transcription factors (TFs) determines whether the cell state corresponds to the progenitor, osteogenic, or chondrogenic cell fate: Tweak, known as a pro-proliferative, differentiation-inhibiting TF; Osx and Sox9 as an osteogenic and a chondrogenic marker, respectively. Ordinary differential equations are used to describe the interactions between these TFs, thus the state of the cell system. 

Our model accounts for extrinsic and intrinsic signals which cells are exposed to in differentiation assays. Extrinsic stimuli are pro-differentiation, pro-osteogenic or pro-chondrogenic stimuli, or combinations of those. Intrinsic signals comprise individual cell properties subject to stochasticity and heterogeneity within cell populations. Both together determine the eventual cell fate. By analyzing different signals, we aim to find combinations, amounts and orders of stimuli which optimize the differentiation outcome.

As we demonstrate by our model, the response of individual cells upon the same stimulus can differ due to heterogeneous parameters. This imposes a limit on the maximum differentiation success rate. Despite several possible stimulation protocols leading to the same accumulated input, the system response might not be equal but depending on the order of stimuli and their time course.

The presented model captures the differentiation process of osteo-chondro progenitor cells and provides a framework to investigate the effects of stimuli on the cell system.},

	Abstract = {Modelling in systems biology often aims at achieving a quantitative description of intracellular signal transduction or differentiation processes at the cellular level. Most models describe a ''typical single cell'' on the basis of experimental data obtained from cell populations. However, in order to understand the dynamical behaviour within heterogeneous cell populations, a consideration of many cells within the whole population is crucial.

Phenotypic heterogeneity of individual cells within one cell population can have different reasons. The most important ones are randomness in biochemical reactions, unequal partitioning of cellular material at cell division, and epigenetic differences. When considering cells with high mutation rate, such as cancer cells, also genotypic heterogeneity can play a major role. Here, we choose to model heterogeneity by differences in parameter values of the model describing the process of interest. The model structure is on the contrary assumed to be identical in all cells, as it usually represents the physical interactions among molecules, which should be independent of the cell's state. This parametric approach is well suited for genetic and epigenetic differences. The distribution of parameter values within the considered cell population is described by a suitable multivariate probability distribution function, which needs to be part of the model specification. 

Mathematical modelling of such cell populations will typically result in a non-linear partial differential equation for the probability distributions of the state variables. Since this is very hard to deal with, we propose to use a sample based approach, consisting of a large collection of ordinary differential equation systems of identical structure, but with differing parameter values which are subject to the specified parameter distribution function.

We present a heuristic approach to estimate the parameter distribution from the distributions of measured concentrations within the cell population. Such data are available on a suitable scale for instance from a newly developed measurement technology, the flow cytometric fluorescence microscopy, which is a combination of classical flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The algorithm used to estimate the parameter distributions consists of two steps. At first, simulation data are generated for a suitable choice of parameter samples. Using these samples in the second step a convex optimisation problem is constructed to compute a suitable weighting for the considered parameter samples. This obtained weighting can directly be transformed into a probability distribution for the parameter values. 

In order to illustrate the suggested estimation method it is applied to artificial data generated from a simple model of the TNF signal transduction pathway. For the parameters where heterogeneity is assumed, our method yields good estimates of the parameter distribution function of the underlying model.

	Abstract = {Objective: In this work we analyze uncertain biochemical reaction networks modelled by ordinary differential equations. The goal is to compute outer bounds for the region of feasible equilibrium points when parameters are allowed to vary in a certain range.

Results: A relaxed version of the corresponding feasibility problem and its Lagrangian dual is used to show how to compute certificates for regions in state space not containing any steady states. The calculation of this certificates can be implemented via semidefinite programming which in combination with a modified bisection algorithm allows an efficient computation of an outer approximation of the region of all feasible equilibrium points.
These bounds are then used to define a global sensitivity measure which in the limit of small parameter uncertainties approaches the absolute value of the first-order sensitivity. In the case of larger uncertainties, the measure indicates effects such as for which perturbation a saturation is reached, or whether there are strong nonlinear coupling effects.
Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to complex intracellular signalling networks by applying it to a model of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signalling pathway. The results of our sensitivity analysis indicate a strong influence of TNF receptor 2 to TNF receptor 1 signalling via the adaptor protein TRAF2, whereas the influence from TNF receptor 1 to TNF receptor 2 is negligible.

Conclusion: The presented method for global sensitivity analysis is computational tractable for medium-size systems and can detect nonlinear effects like saturation and coupling.},

	Abstract = {In many situations of biological relevance individual cells within a clonal population show
different responses upon a common stimulus. One example are populations of cancer
cells where some cells die upon a death signal and others survive. Although the decision
at the single cell level is binary a continuous response can be observed at the population
scale.

Within this project a population of NCI-H460 tumor cells is studied. This population is
highly heterogeneous as single cells of this population differ in protein expression levels
and sensitivities with respect to the cytokine TRAIL. To achieve a better understanding of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a cell population a multi-scale model is developed.

This mathematical model describes TRAIL signaling in single-cells on the basis of
mechanistic ordinary differential equations, whereas the population is modeled by an
ensemble of individual cells. This leads to a partial differential equation governing the
population dynamics. Cell-to-cell variability is introduced by differences in protein synthesis
rates among individual cells, interpretable as epigenetic differences. The distribution of the
synthesis rates is estimated from data obtained by flow cytometry.

We show that epigenetic differences can explain the distribution of death instances
observed in experiments. Plausible markers for the survival or death of individual cells
could be determined. The model indicates that e.g. for high TRAIL concentrations mainly
differences in procaspase 3 and XIAP expression levels play crucial roles for the cell fate
decision, whereas for low TRAIL concentrations also the procaspase 8 expression level
might represent an important marker. Variability within the mitochondrial pathway appears
negligible, which is in accordance with experimental data. The comparison of the model
predictions with the experimental data supports the predictive power achieved by the
combination of the single-cell model and cell population heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneity between individual cells is a common feature of dynamic cellular processes, including signaling, transcription, and cell fate; yet the overall tissue level physiological phenotype needs to be carefully controlled to avoid fluctuations. Here we show that in the NF-κB signaling system, the precise timing of a dual-delayed negative feedback motif [involving stochastic transcription of inhibitor κB (IκB)-α and -ε] is optimized to induce heterogeneous timing of NF-κB oscillations between individual cells. We suggest that this dual-delayed negative feedback motif enables NF-κB signaling to generate robust single cell oscillations by reducing sensitivity to key parameter perturbations. Simultaneously, enhanced cell heterogeneity may represent a mechanism that controls the overall coordination and stability of cell population responses by decreasing temporal fluctuations of paracrine signaling. It has often been thought that dynamic biological systems may have evolved to maximize robustness through cell-to-cell coordination and homogeneity. Our analyses suggest in contrast, that this cellular variation might be advantageous and subject to evolutionary selection. Alternative types of therapy could perhaps be designed to modulate this cellular heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {High throughput measurement of gene expression at single-cell resolution, combined with systematic perturbation of environmental or cellular variables, provides information that can be used to generate novel insight into the properties of gene regulatory networks by linking cellular responses to external parameters. In dynamical systems theory, this information is the subject of bifurcation analysis, which establishes how system-level behaviour changes as a function of parameter values within a given deterministic mathematical model. Since cellular networks are inherently noisy, we generalize the traditional bifurcation diagram of deterministic systems theory to stochastic dynamical systems. We demonstrate how statistical methods for density estimation, in particular, mixture density and conditional mixture density estimators, can be employed to establish empirical bifurcation diagrams describing the bistable genetic switch network controlling galactose utilization in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These approaches allow us to make novel qualitative and quantitative observations about the switching behavior of the galactose network, and provide a framework that might be useful to extract information needed for the development of quantitative network models.},

@article{RumschinskiBor2010,
	Abstract = {Background: Mathematical modeling and analysis have become, for the study of biological and cellular processes, an important complement to experimental research. However, the structural and quantitative knowledge available for such processes is frequently limited, and measurements are often subject to inherent and possibly large uncertainties. This results in competing model hypotheses, whose kinetic parameters may not be experimentally determinable. Discriminating among these alternatives and estimating their kinetic parameters is crucial to improve the understanding of the considered process, and to benefit from the analytical tools at hand. 

Results: In this work we present a set-based framework that allows to discriminate between competing model hypotheses and to provide guaranteed outer estimates on the model parameters that are consistent with the (possibly sparse and uncertain) experimental measurements. This is obtained by means of exact proofs of model invalidity that exploit the polynomial/rational structure of biochemical reaction networks, and by making use of an efficient strategy to balance solution accuracy and computational effort.

Conclusions: The practicability of our approach is illustrated with two case studies. The first study shows that our approach allows to conclusively rule out wrong model hypotheses. The second study focuses on parameter estimation, and shows that the proposed method allows to evaluate the global influence of measurement

	Abstract = {Experimental design is important in system identification, especially when the models are complex and the measurement data are sparse and noisy, as often occurs in modelling of biochemical regulatory networks. The quality of conventional optimal experimental design largely depends on the accuracy of model parameter estimation, which is often either unavailable or poorly estimated at the stage of design. Robust experimental design (RED) algorithms have thus been proposed when model parametric uncertainties need to be addressed during the design process. In this paper, two robust design strategies are investigated and the comparative study has been made on signal pathway models. The first method is a maximin experimental design approach which is a worst-case design strategy, and the second method is the Bayesian experimental design that takes an average of the parametric uncertainty effects. The limitations of the maximin design which describes the structural uncertainty using a local Taylor representation are quantitatively evaluated. To better quantitatively assess the differences between the maximin and the Bayesian REDs, a concept of effective design parameters is proposed, from which the advantages of the Bayesian design is demonstrated especially in the case of large model uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity has been widely observed in cellular populations. However, the extent to which heterogeneity contains biologically or clinically important information is not well understood. Here, we investigated whether patterns of basal signaling heterogeneity, in untreated cancer cell populations, could distinguish cellular populations with different drug sensitivities. We modeled cellular heterogeneity as a mixture of stereotyped signaling states, identified based on colocalization patterns of activated signaling molecules from microscopy images. We found that patterns of heterogeneity could be used to separate the most sensitive and resistant populations to paclitaxel within a set of H460 lung cancer clones and within the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines, but not for a set of less heterogeneous, immortalized noncancer human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) clones. Our results suggest that patterns of signaling heterogeneity, characterized as ensembles of a small number of distinct phenotypic states, can reveal functional differences among cellular populations.},

@article{AlbeckBur2008b,
	Abstract = {When exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration in which only upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, snap-action switch that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control.},

	Abstract = {This paper concerns the simplification of model structures of nonlinear systems while preserving their input-output maps. The basic technique is an immersion of a system, which is a mapping of the initial state from the original system to another system of an identical input--output map. The necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the immersibility of a given system into a state-space representation of such particular structures as rational functions or polynomials with respect to the state. The conditions are so mild that many types of nonlinear systems can be represented by rational or polynomial model structures. Moreover, it is also shown that a polynomial state-space representation can always be constructed to be at most quadratic with respect to the state.},

	Abstract = {This work introduces a unified framework for model invalidation and parameter estimation for nonlinear systems. We consider a model given by implicit nonlinear difference equations that are polynomial in the variables. Experimental data is assumed to be available as possibly sparse, uncertain, but (set-)bounded measurements. The derived approach is based on the reformulation of the invalidation and parameter/state estimation tasks into a set-based feasibility problem. Exploiting the polynomial structure of the considered model class, the resulting non-convex feasibility problem is relaxed into a convex semi-definite one, for which infeasibility can be efficiently checked. The parameter/state estimation
task is then reformulated as an outer-bounding problem. In comparison to other methods, we check for feasibility of whole parameter/state regions. The practicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with two simple biological example systems.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in semidefinite programming along with use of the sum of squares decomposition to check nonnegativity have paved the way for efficient and algorithmic analysis of systems with polynomial vector fields. In this paper we present a systematic methodology for analyzing the more general class of non-polynomial vector fields, by recasting them into rational vector fields. The sum of squares decomposition techniques can then be applied in conjunction with an extension of the Lyapunov stability theorem to investigate the stability and other properties of the recasted systems, from which properties of the original, non-polynomial systems can be inferred. This will be illustrated by some examples from the mechanical and chemical engineering domains.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Modern experimental techniques for time course measurement of gene expression enable the identification of dynamical models of genetic regulatory networks. In general, identification involves fitting appropriate network structures and parameters to the data. For a given set of genes, exploring all possible network structures is clearly prohibitive. Modelling and identification methods for the a priori selection of network structures compatible with biological knowledge and experimental data are necessary to make the identification problem tractable.

Results: We propose a differential equation modelling framework where the regulatory interactions among genes are expressed in terms of unate functions, a class of gene activation rules commonly encountered in Boolean network modelling. We establish analytical properties of the models in the class and exploit them to devise a two-step procedure for gene network reconstruction from product concentration and synthesis rate time series. The first step isolates a family of model structures compatible with the data from a set of most relevant biological hypotheses. The second step explores this family and returns a pool of best fitting models along with estimates of their parameters. The method is tested on a simulated network and compared with state-of-the-art network inference methods on the benchmark synthetic network IRMA.},

@article{GutenkunstWat2007,
	Abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a ``sloppy'' spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

	Abstract = {Biophysically detailed models of single cells are difficult to fit to real data. Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo (``particle filtering'') methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximisation. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise. },

@article{Klinke2009,
	Abstract = {Background: A common challenge in systems biology is to infer mechanistic descriptions of biological process given limited observations of a biological system. Mathematical models are frequently used to represent a belief about the causal relationships among proteins within a signaling network. Bayesian methods provide an attractive framework for inferring the validity of those beliefs in the context of the available data. However, efficient sampling of high-dimensional parameter space and appropriate convergence criteria provide barriers for implementing an empirical Bayesian approach. The objective of this study was to apply an Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to a typical study of cellular signaling pathways.

Results: As an illustrative example, a kinetic model for the early signaling events associated with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling network was calibrated against dynamic measurements observed in primary rat hepatocytes. A convergence criterion, based upon the Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor, was applied to the model predictions. The posterior distributions of the parameters exhibited complicated structure, including significant covariance between specific parameters and a broad range of variance among the parameters. The model predictions, in contrast, were narrowly distributed and were used to identify areas of agreement among a collection of experimental studies.

Conclusion: In summary, an empirical Bayesian approach was developed for inferring the confidence that one can place in a particular model that describes signal transduction mechanisms and for inferring inconsistencies in experimental measurements.},

	Abstract = {Background: The problem of estimating the parameters of dynamic models of complex biological systems from time series data is becoming increasingly important.

Methods and results: Particular consideration is given to metabolic systems that are formulated as Generalized Mass Action (GMA) models. The estimation problem is posed as a global optimization task, for which novel techniques can be applied to determine the best set of parameter values given the measured responses of the biological system. The challenge is that this task is nonconvex. Nonetheless, deterministic optimization techniques can be used to find a global solution that best reconciles the model parameters and measurements. Specifically, the paper employs branch-and-bound principles to identify the best set of model parameters from observed time course data and illustrates this method with an existing model of the fermentation pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is a relatively simple yet representative system with five dependent states and a total of 19 unknown parameters of which the values are to be determined.

Conclusion: The efficacy of the branch-and-reduce algorithm is illustrated by the S. cerevisiae example. The method described in this paper is likely to be widely applicable in the dynamic modeling of metabolic networks.},

	Abstract = {Cell fate decisions are regulated by the coordinated activation of signalling pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade, but contributions of individual kinase isoforms are mostly unknown. By combining quantitative data from erythropoietin-induced pathway activation in primary erythroid progenitor (colony-forming unit erythroid stage, CFU-E) cells with mathematical modelling, we predicted and experimentally confirmed a distributive ERK phosphorylation mechanism in CFU-E cells. Model analysis showed bow-tie-shaped signal processing and inherently transient signalling for cytokine-induced ERK signalling. Sensitivity analysis predicted that, through a feedback-mediated process, increasing one ERK isoform reduces activation of the other isoform, which was verified by protein over-expression. We calculated ERK activation for biochemically not addressable but physiologically relevant ligand concentrations showing that double-phosphorylated ERK1 attenuates proliferation beyond a certain activation level, whereas activated ERK2 enhances proliferation with saturation kinetics. Thus, we provide a quantitative link between earlier unobservable signalling dynamics and cell fate decisions.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Mathematical modelling of biological systems is becoming a standard approach to investigate complex dynamic, non-linear interaction mechanisms in cellular processes. However, models may comprise non-identifiable parameters which cannot be unambiguously determined. Non-identifiability manifests itself in functionally related parameters, which are difficult to detect.

Results: We present the method of mean optimal transformations, a non-parametric bootstrap-based algorithm for identifiability testing, capable of identifying linear and non-linear relations of arbitrarily many parameters, regardless of model size or complexity. This is performed with use of optimal transformations, estimated using the alternating conditional expectation algorithm (ACE). An initial guess or prior knowledge concerning the underlying relation of the parameters is not required. Independent, and hence identifiable parameters are determined as well. The quality of data at disposal is included in our approach, i.e. the non-linear model is fitted to data and estimated parameter values are investigated with respect to functional relations. We exemplify our approach on a realistic dynamical model and demonstrate that the variability of estimated parameter values decreases from 81 to 1% after detection and fixation of structural non-identifiabilities.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Modelers in Systems Biology need a flexible framework that allows them to easily create new dynamic models, investigate their properties and fit several experimental datasets simultaneously. Multi-experiment-fitting is a powerful approach to estimate parameter values, to check the validity of a given model, and to discriminate competing model hypotheses. It requires high-performance integration of ordinary differential equations and robust optimization.

Results: We here present the comprehensive modeling framework PottersWheel (PW) including novel functionalities to satisfy these requirements with strong emphasis on the inverse problem, i.e. data-based modeling of partially observed and noisy systems like signal transduction pathways and metabolic networks. PW is designed as a MATLAB toolbox and includes numerous user interfaces. Deterministic and stochastic optimization routines are combined by fitting in logarithmic parameter space allowing for robust parameter calibration. Model investigation includes statistical tests for model-data-compliance, model discrimination, identifiability analysis and calculation of Hessian- and Monte-Carlobased parameter confidence limits. A rich application programming interface is available for customization within own MATLAB code. Within an extensive performance analysis, we identified and significantly improved an integrator-optimizer pair which decreases the fitting duration for a realistic benchmark model by a factor over 3000 compared to MATLAB with optimization toolbox.

Availability: PottersWheel is freely available for academic usage at http://www.PottersWheel.de/. The website contains a detailed documentation and introductory videos. The program has been intensively used since 2005 on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers and does not require special MATLAB toolboxes.},

@article{KueglerGau2009,
	Abstract = {Complex chemical reactions are commonly described by systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Rate and equilibrium constants of these models are usually not directly accessible and have to be indirectly inferred from experimental observations of the system. As a consequence, parameter identification problems have to be formulated and computationally solved. Because of a limited amount of information and uncertainties in the data, the solutions to such parameter identification problems typically lack uniqueness and stability properties and hence cannot be found in a reliable way by a pure minimization of the data mismatch (i.e., the discrepancy between experimental observations and simulated model output). To overcome these difficulties, so-called regularization methods have to be used. In this article, we suggest a sparsity promoting regularization approach that eliminates unidentifiable model parameters (i.e., parameters of low or no sensitivity to the given data). That way, the model is reduced to a core reaction mechanism with manageable interpretation while still remaining in accordance with the experimental observations. For the computational realization, we utilize the adjoint state technique for an efficient calculation of the gradient of the objective with respect to model parameters as well as uncertain initial and experimental conditions. Illustrations of our approach are given by means of the chlorite-iodide reaction for which reference parameter values are available.},

	Abstract = {Gene regulatory, signal transduction and metabolic networks are major areas of interest in the newly emerging field of systems biology. In living cells, stochastic dynamics play an important role; however, the kinetic parameters of biochemical reactions necessary for modelling these processes are often not accessible directly through experiments. The problem of estimating stochastic reaction constants from molecule count data measured, with error, at discrete time points is considered. For modelling the system, a hidden Markov process is used, where the hidden states are the true molecule counts, and the transitions between those states correspond to reaction events following collisions of molecules. Two different algorithms are proposed for estimating the unknown model parameters. The first is an approximate maximum likelihood method that gives good estimates of the reaction parameters in systems with few possible reactions in each sampling interval. The second algorithm, treating the data as exact measurements, approximates the number of reactions in each sampling interval by solving a simple linear equation. Maximising the likelihood based on these approximations can provide good results, even in complex reaction systems.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Quantitative experimental data is the critical bottleneck in the modeling of dynamic cellular processes in systems biology. Here, we present statistical approaches improving reproducibility of protein quantification by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting.

Results: Based on a large data set with more than 3600 data points, we unravel that the main sources of biological variability and experimental noise are multiplicative and log-normally distributed. Therefore, we suggest a log-transformation of the data to obtain additive normally distributed noise. After this transformation, common statistical procedures can be applied to analyze the data. An error model is introduced to account for technical as well as biological variability. Elimination of these systematic errors decrease variability of measurements and allow for a more precise estimation of underlying dynamics of protein concentrations in cellular signaling. The proposed error model is relevant for simulation studies, parameter estimation and model selection, basic tools of systems biology.

	Abstract = {Motivation: Mathematical description of biological reaction networks by differential equations leads to large models whose parameters are calibrated in order to optimally explain experimental data. Often only parts of the model can be observed directly. Given a model that sufficiently describes the measured data, it is important to infer how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. This knowledge is essential for further investigation of model predictions. For this reason a major topic in modeling is identifiability analysis.

Results: We suggest an approach that exploits the profile likelihood. It enables to detect structural non-identifiabilities, which manifest in functionally related model parameters. Furthermore, practical nonidentifiabilities are detected, that might arise due to limited amount and quality of experimental data. Last but not least confidence intervals can be derived. The results are easy to interpret and can be used for experimental planning and for model reduction.

	Abstract = {Apoptosis in response to TRAIL or TNF requires the activation of initiator caspases, which then activate the effector caspases that dismantle cells and cause death. However, little is known about the dynamics and regulatory logic linking initiators and effectors. Using a combination of live-cell reporters, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, we find that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical model of core apoptosis pathways, experimental perturbation of regulatory links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay. We identify conditions in which restraint is impaired, creating a physiologically indeterminate state of partial cell death with the potential to generate genomic instability. Together, these findings provide a quantitative picture of caspase regulatory networks and their failure modes.},

	Abstract = {Advances in fluorescent labeling of cells as measured by flow cytometry have allowed for quantitative studies of proliferating populations of cells. The investigations (Luzyanina et al. in J.Math. Biol. 54:57--89, 2007; J.Math. Biol., 2009; Theor. Biol. Med. Model. 4:1--26, 2007) contain a mathematical model with fluorescence intensity as a structure variable to describe the evolution in time of proliferating cells labeled by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Here, this model and several extensions/modifications are discussed. Suggestions for improvements are presented and analyzed with respect to statistical significance for better agreement between model solutions and experimental data. These investigations suggest that the new decay/label loss and time dependent effective proliferation and death rates do indeed provide improved fits of the model to data. Statistical models for the observed variability/noise in the data are discussed with implications for uncertainty quantification. The resulting new cell dynamics model should prove useful in proliferation assay tracking and modeling, with numerous applications in the biomedical sciences.},

	Abstract = {The complexity of the systemic inflammatory response and the lack of a treatment breakthrough in the treatment of pathogenic infection demand that advanced tools be brought to bear in the treatment of severe sepsis and trauma. Systems medicine, the translational science counterpart to basic science's systems biology, is the interface at which these tools may be constructed. Rapid initial strides in improving sepsis treatment are possible through the use of phenomenological modelling and optimization tools for process understanding and device design. Higher impact, and more generalizable, treatment designs are based on mechanistic understanding developed through the use of physiologically based models, characterization of population variability, and the use of control-theoretic systems engineering concepts. In this review we introduce acute inflammation and sepsis as an example of just one area that is currently underserved by the systems medicine community, and, therefore, an area in which contributions of all types can be made.},

	Abstract = {Background
The success of molecular systems biology hinges on the ability to use computational models to design predictive experiments, and ultimately unravel underlying biological mechanisms. A problem commonly encountered in the computational modelling of biological networks is that alternative, structurally different models of similar complexity fit a set of experimental data equally well. In this case, more than one molecular mechanism can explain available data. In order to rule out the incorrect mechanisms, one needs to invalidate incorrect models. At this point, new experiments maximizing the difference between the measured values of alternative models should be proposed and conducted. Such experiments should be optimally designed to produce data that are most likely to invalidate incorrect model structures.

Results
In this paper we develop methodologies for the optimal design of experiments with the aim of discriminating between different mathematical models of the same biological system. The first approach determines the `best' initial condition that maximizes the L_2 (energy) distance between the outputs of the rival models. In the second approach, we maximize the L_2-distance of the outputs by designing the optimal external stimulus (input) profile of unit L_2-norm. Our third method uses optimized structural changes (corresponding, for example, to parameter value changes reflecting gene knock-outs) to achieve the same goal. The numerical implementation of each method is considered in an example, signal processing in starving Dictyostelium amoebae.

Conclusions
Model-based design of experiments improves both the reliability and the efficiency of biochemical network model discrimination. This opens the way to model invalidation, which can be used to perfect our understanding of biochemical networks. Our general problem formulation together with the three proposed experiment design methods give the practitioner new tools for a systems biology approach to experiment design.},

If the parameters of a model are unknown, results from simulation studies can be misleading. Such a scenario can be avoided by estimating the parameters before analysing the system. Almost all approaches for estimating parameters in ordinary differential equations have either a small convergence region or suffer from an immense computational cost. The method of multiple shooting can be situated in between of these extremes. In spite of its good convergence and stability properties, the literature regarding the practical implementation and providing some theoretical background is rarely available. All necessary information for a successful implementation is supplied here and the basic facts of the involved numerics are discussed. To show the performance of the method, two illustrative examples are discussed.},

	Abstract = {An extremal property of normal distributions is that they have the smallest Fisher Information for location among all distributions with the same variance. A new test of normality proposed by Terrell (1995) utilizes the above property by finding that density of maximum likelihood constrained on having the expected Fisher Information under normality based on the sample variance. The test statistic is then constructed as a ratio of the resulting likelihood against that of normality.

Since the asymptotic distribution of this test statistic is not available, the critical values for n = 3 to 200 have been obtained by simulation and smoothed using polynomials. An extensive power study shows that the test has superior power against distributions that are symmetric and leptokurtic (long-tailed). Another advantage of the test over existing ones is the direct depiction of any deviation from normality in the form of a density estimate. This is evident when the test is applied to several real data sets. Testing of normality in residuals is also investigated. Various approaches in dealing with residuals being possibly heteroscedastic and correlated suffer from a loss of power. The approach with the fewest undesirable features is to use the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) residuals in place of independent observations. From simulations, it is shown that one has to be careful about the levels of the normality tests and also in generalizing the results.},

@article{Coulon2010,
	Abstract = {Background: Gene promoters can be in various epigenetic states and undergo interactions with many molecules in a highly transient, probabilistic and combinatorial way, resulting in a complex global dynamics as observed experimentally. However, models of stochastic gene expression commonly consider promoter activity as a twostate on/off system. We consider here a model of single-gene stochastic expression that can represent arbitrary prokaryotic or eukaryotic promoters, based on the combinatorial interplay between molecules and epigenetic factors, including energy-dependent remodeling and enzymatic activities.

Results: We show that, considering the mere molecular interplay at the promoter, a single-gene can demonstrate an elaborate spontaneous stochastic activity (eg. multi-periodic multi-relaxation dynamics), similar to what is known to occur at the gene-network level. Characterizing this generic model with indicators of dynamic and steady-state properties (including power spectra and distributions), we reveal the potential activity of any promoter and its influence on gene expression. In particular, we can reproduce, based on biologically relevant mechanisms, the strongly periodic patterns of promoter occupancy by transcription factors (TF) and chromatin remodeling as observed experimentally on eukaryotic promoters. Moreover, we link several of its characteristics to properties of the underlying biochemical system. The model can also be used to identify behaviors of interest (e.g. stochasticity induced by high TF concentration) on minimal systems and to test their relevance in larger and more realistic systems. We finally show that TF concentrations can regulate many aspects of the stochastic activity with a considerable flexibility and complexity.

Conclusions: This tight promoter-mediated control of stochasticity may constitute a powerful asset for the cell. Remarkably, a strongly periodic activity that demonstrates a complex TF concentration-dependent control is obtained when molecular interactions have typical characteristics observed on eukaryotic promoters (high mobility, functional redundancy, many alternate states/pathways). We also show that this regime results in a direct and indirect energetic cost. Finally, this model can constitute a framework for unifying various experimental approaches. Collectively, our results show that a gene - the basic building block of complex regulatory networks - can itself demonstrate a significantly complex behavior.},

	Abstract = {The dynamical systems arising from gene regulatory, signalling and metabolic networks are strongly nonlinear, have high-dimensional state spaces and depend on large numbers of parameters. Understanding the relation between the structure and the function for such systems is a considerable challenge. We need tools to identify key points of regulation, illuminate such issues as robustness and control and aid in the design of experiments. Here, I tackle this by developing new techniques for sensitivity analysis. In particular, I show how to globally analyse the sensitivity of a complex systemby means of two new graphical objects: the sensitivity heat map and the parameter sensitivity spectrum. The approach to sensitivity analysis is global in the sense that it studies the variation in the whole of the model's solution rather than focusing on output variables one at a time, as in classical sensitivity analysis. This viewpoint relies on the discovery of local geometric rigidity for such systems, the mathematical insight that makes a practicable approach to such problems feasible for highly complex systems. In addition, we demonstrate a new summation theorem that substantially generalizes previous results for oscillatory and other dynamical phenomena. This theorem can be interpreted as a mathematical law stating the need for a balance between fragility and robustness in such systems.},

Typical examples of this include active sonar tracking with range-bearing measurements and passive sonar tracking with bearings-only measurements, where target state is position and velocity in Cartesian coordinates. In this paper, ellipsoidal set based estimators are derived for both of these nonlinear measurement scenarios. The premise of an estimate that provides a guaranteed bound on target state is maintained throughout the paper. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented for each type of nonlinear measurement, including a comparison with the extended Kalman filter in the case of bearings-only measurements.},

We prove that the value of the span is always smaller (and can be much smaller) than the diameter of the smallest sphere containing the support vectors, used in previous bounds (Vapnik, 1998). We also demonstate experimentally that the prediction of the test error given by the span is very accurate and has direct application in model selection (choice of the optimal parameters of the SVM).},

@article{Vapnik1999,
	Abstract = {Statistical learning theory was introduced in the late 1960's. Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems. A more detailed overview of the theory (without proofs) can be found in Vapnik (1995). In Vapnik (1998) one can find detailed description of the theory (including proofs)},

	Abstract = {The localization of critical parameter sets called bifurcations is often a central task of the analysis of a nonlinear dynamical system. Bifurcations of codimension 1 that can be directly observed in nature and experiments form surfaces in three-dimensional parameter spaces. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that combines adaptive triangulation with the theory of complex systems to compute and visualize such bifurcation surfaces in a very efficient way. The visualization can enhance the qualitative understanding of a system. Moreover, it can help to quickly locate more complex bifurcation situations corresponding to bifurcations of higher codimension at the intersections of bifurcation surfaces. Together with the approach of generalized models the proposed algorithm enables us to gain extensive insights in the local and global dynamics not only in one special system but in whole classes of systems. To illustrate this ability we analyze three examples from different fields of science.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: There often are many alternative models of a biochemical system. Distinguishing models and finding the most suitable ones is an important challenge in Systems Biology, as such model ranking, by experimental evidence, will help to judge the support of the working hypotheses forming each model.
Bayes factors are employed as a measure of evidential preference for one model over another. Marginal likelihood is a key component of Bayes factors, however computing the marginal likelihood is a difficult problem, as it involves integration of nonlinear functions in multidimensional space. There are a number of methods available to compute the marginal likelihood approximately. A detailed investigation of such methods is required to find ones that perform appropriately for biochemical modelling.

Results: We assess four methods for estimation of the marginal likelihoods required for computing Bayes factors. The Prior Arithmetic Mean estimator, the Posterior Harmonic Mean estimator, the Annealed Importance Sampling and the Annealing-Melting Integration methods are investigated and compared on a typical case study in Systems Biology. This allows us to understand the stability of the analysis results and make reliable judgements in uncertain context. We investigate the variance of Bayes factor estimates, and highlight the stability of the Annealed Importance Sampling and the Annealing-Melting Integration methods for the purposes of comparing nonlinear models.},

Bayesian methods offer a number of advantages over more conventional statistical techniques that make them particularly appropriate for complex data. It is therefore no surprise that Bayesian methods are becoming more widely used in the fields of genetics, genomics, bioinformatics and computational systems biology, where making sense of complex noisy data is the norm. This review provides an introduction to the growing literature in this area, with particular emphasis on recent developments in Bayesian bioinformatics relevant to computational systems biology.},

	Abstract = {The hope of the rapid translation of `genes to drugs' has foundered on the reality that disease biology is complex, and that drug development must be driven by insights into biological responses. Systems biology aims to describe and to understand the operation of complex biological systems and ultimately to develop predictive models of human disease. Although meaningful molecular level models of human cell and tissue function are a distant goal, systems biology efforts are already influencing drug discovery. Large-scale gene, protein and metabolite measurements (`omics') dramatically accelerate hypothesis generation and testing in disease models. Computer simulations integrating knowledge of organ and system-level responses help prioritize targets and design clinical trials. Automation of complex primary human cell-based assay systems designed to capture emergent properties can now integrate a broad range of disease-relevant human biology into the drug discovery process, informing target and compound validation, lead optimization, and clinical indication selection. These systems biology approaches promise to improve decision making in pharmaceutical development.},

A mathematical model for the interactions of cdc2 and cyclin is constructed. Simulation and analysis of the model show that the control system can operate in three modes: as a steady state with high maturation promoting factor activity, as a spontaneous oscillator, or as an excitable switch. We associate the steady state with metaphase arrest in unfertilized eggs, the spontaneous oscillations with rapid division cycles in early embryos, and the excitable switch with growthcontrolled division cycles typical of nonembryonic cells.},

	Abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in identifying the molecular composition of complex signaling networks controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. However, to discover general building principles and predict the dynamic behavior of signaling networks, it is necessary to develop quantitative models based on experimental observations. Here we report a mathematical model of the core module of the Janus family of kinases (JAK)--signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway based on time-resolved measurements of receptor and STAT5 phosphorylation. Applying the fitted model, we can determine the quantitative behavior of STAT5 populations not accessible to experimental measurement. By in silico investigations, we identify the parameters of nuclear shuttling as the most sensitive to perturbations and verify experimentally the model prediction that inhibition of nuclear export results in a reduced transcriptional yield. The model reveals that STAT5 undergoes rapid nucleocytoplasmic cycles, continuously coupling receptor activation and target gene transcription, thereby forming a remote sensor between nucleus and receptor. Thus, dynamic modeling of signaling pathways can promote functional understanding at the systems level.},

	Abstract = {Integration of experimental studies with mathematical modeling allows insight into systems properties, prediction of perturbation effects and generation of hypotheses for further research. We present a comprehensive mathematical description of the cellular response of yeast to hyperosmotic shock. The model integrates a biochemical reaction network comprising receptor stimulation, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade dynamics, activation of gene expression and adaptation of cellular metabolism with a thermodynamic description of volume regulation and osmotic pressure. Simulations agree well with experimental results obtained under different stress conditions or with specific mutants. The model is predictive since it suggests previously unrecognized features of the system with respect to osmolyte accumulation and feedback control, as confirmed with experiments. The mathematical description presented is a valuable tool for future studies on osmoregulation in yeast and---with appropriate modifications---other organisms. It also serves as a starting point for a comprehensive description of cellular signaling.},

	Abstract = {Background: Mathematical models provide abstract representations of the information gained from experimental observations on the structure and function of a particular biological system. Conferring a predictive character on a given mathematical formulation often relies on determining a number of non-measurable parameters that largely condition the model's response. These parameters can be identified by fitting the model to experimental data. However, this fit can only be accomplished when identifiability can be guaranteed.

Results: We propose a novel iterative identification procedure for detecting and dealing with the lack of identifiability. The procedure involves the following steps: 1) performing a structural identifiability analysis to detect identifiable parameters; 2) globally ranking the parameters to assist in the selection of the most relevant parameters; 3) calibrating the model using global optimization methods; 4) conducting a practical identifiability analysis consisting of two (a priori and a posteriori) phases aimed at evaluating the quality of given experimental designs and of the parameter estimates, respectively and 5) optimal experimental design so as to compute the scheme of experiments that maximizes the quality and quantity of information for fitting the model.

Conclusions: The presented procedure was used to iteratively identify a mathematical model that describes the NF-kB regulatory module involving several unknown parameters. We demonstrated the lack of identifiability of the model under typical experimental conditions and computed optimal dynamic experiments that largely improved identifiability properties.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis is regulated by several signaling pathways which are extensively linked by crosstalks. Boolean or logical modeling has become a promising approach to capture the qualitative behavior of such complex networks. Here we built a largescale literature-based Boolean model of the central intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways as well as pathways
connected with them. The model responds to several external stimuli such as Fas ligand, TNF-a, UV-B irradiation, interleukin-1b and insulin. Timescales and multi-value node logic were used and turned out to be indispensable to reproduce the behavior of the apoptotic network. The coherence of the model was experimentally validated. Thereby an UV-B dose-effect is shown for the first time in mouse hepatocytes. Analysis of the model revealed a tight regulation emerging from high connectivity and spanning crosstalks and a particular importance of feedback loops. An unexpected feedback from Smac release to RIP could further increase complex II formation. The introduced Boolean model provides a comprehensive and coherent description of the apoptosis network behavior. It gives new insights into the complex interplay of pro- and antiapoptotic factors and can be easily expanded to other signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {The activation of caspases is a central mechanism in apoptosis. To gain further insights into complex processes like this, mathematical modelling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be a very powerful research tool. Unfortunately, the lack of measurement data is a common problem in building such kinetic models, because it practically constrains the identifiability of the model parameters. An existing mathematical model of caspase activation during apoptosis was used in order to design future experimental setups that will help to maximise the obtained information. For this purpose, artificial measurement data are generated in silico to simulate potential experiments, and the model is fitted to this data. The model is also analysed using observability gramian and sensitivity analyses. The used analysis methods are compared. The artificial data approach allows one to make conclusions about system properties, identifiability of parameters and the potential information content of additional measurements for the used caspase activation model. The latter facilitates to improve the experimental design of further measurements significantly. The performed analyses reveal that several kinetic parameters are not at all, or only scarcely, identifiable, and that measurements of activated caspase 8 will maximally improve the parameter estimates. Furthermore, we can show that many assays with inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) knockout cells only provide redundant information for our needs and as such do not have to be carried out.},

	Abstract = {Systems biology applies quantitative, mechanistic modelling to study genetic networks, signal transduction pathways and metabolic networks. Mathematical models of biochemical networks can look very different. An important reason is that the purpose and application of a model are essential for the selection of the best mathematical framework. Fundamental aspects of selecting an appropriate modelling framework and a strategy for model building are discussed.
Concepts and methods from system and control theory provide a sound basis for the further development of improved and dedicated computational tools for systems biology. Identification of the network components and rate constants that are most critical to the output behaviour of the system is one of the major problems raised in systems biology. Current approaches and methods of parameter sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation are reviewed. It is shown how these methods can be applied in the design of model-based experiments which iteratively yield models that are decreasingly wrong and increasingly gain predictive power.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of active model selection for nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose a novel learning approach that selects the most informative subset of time-dependent variables for the purpose of Bayesian model inference. The model selection criterion maximizes the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the posterior probabilities over the models. The proposed strategy generalizes the standard D-optimal design, which is obtained from a uniform prior with Gaussian noise. In addition, our approach allows us to determine an information halting criterion for model identification. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by differentiating between 18 published biochemical models of the TOR signaling pathway, a model selection problem in systems biology. By generating pivotal selection experiments, our strategy outperforms the standard A-optimal, D-optimal and E-optimal sequential design techniques.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of optimal experimental design in structure identification. Whereas standard approaches simply minimize Shannon's entropy of the estimated parameter posterior, we show how to select between alternative model configurations, too. Our method specifies the intervention that makes an experiment capable of determining whether or not a particular configuration hypothesis is correct. This is performed by a novel clustering technique in approximated Bayesian parameter estimation for non-linear dynamical systems. The computation of the perturbation that minimizes the effective number of clusters in the belief state is constrained by the increase of the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the parameter prior and the posterior. This enables the disambiguation of persisting alternative explanations in cases where standard design systematically fails. Its applicability is illustrated with a biochemical Goodwin model, showing correct identification between multiple kinetic structures. We expect that our approach will prove useful especially for complex structures with reduced observability and multimodal posteriors.},

	Abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) were originally designed for binary classification. How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such ``all-together'' methods. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: ``one-against-all,'' ``one-against-one,'' and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM). Our experiments indicate that the ``one-against-one'' and DAG methods are more suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in general need fewer support vectors.},

	Abstract = {The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binds two distinct plasma membrane receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. We have produced different receptor mutants fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein to study their membrane dynamics by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). TNFR1 mutants show diffusion constants of approximately 1.2 × 10− 9 cm2/s and a broad distribution of diffusion times, which is hardly affected by ligand binding. However, cholesterol depletion enhances their diffusion, suggesting a constitutive affinity to cholesterol rich membrane microdomains. In contrast, TNFR2 and mutants thereof diffuse rather fast (D̄ = 3.1 × 10− 9 cm2/s) with a marked reduction after 30 min of TNF treatment (D̄ = 0.9 × 10− 9 cm2/s). This reduction cannot be explained by the formation of higher ordered receptor clusters, since the fluorescence intensity of TNF treated receptors indicate the presence of a few receptor molecules per complex only. Together, these data point to a topological segregation of the two TNF receptors in different microcompartments of the plasma membrane independent of the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptors.},

	Abstract = {Most members of the tumor necrosis factor ligand family form noncovalently linked homotrimers, capable to bind up to three molecules of the respective membrane receptors. For several receptors a membrane distal homophilic interaction domain has been identified, called pre-ligand binding assembly domain. Accordingly, affinity values determined by typical equilibrium binding studies are likely to be influenced by avidity effects. Using our recently introduced covalently stabilized TNF (single chain TNF, scTNF), we have here investigated receptor--ligand binding stoichiometry in our well characterized system of TNFR--Fas chimeras. We produced scTNF derivatives with functionally deleted individual receptor binding sites, resulting in TNF mutants capable to only bind to one or two receptor molecules, rather than three. Equilibrium binding affinity studies on ice with these molecules revealed no significant changes after a single receptor binding site had been functionally deleted. In contrast, functional abrogation of two receptor binding sites showed a strong decrease in both, affinity and bioactivity on TNFR2--Fas. In contrast, TNFR1--Fas ligand binding and receptor activation was only affected after functional deletion of all three receptor binding sites. Our data demonstrate pivotal differences in ligand/receptor interactions between TNFR1--Fas and TNFR2--Fas, arguing for avidity effects important for TNF binding and downstream signaling of TNFR2, but to a lesser extent of TNFR1. These results are supported by data revealed from chemical crosslinking experiments suggesting the existence of preformed TNFR--Fas homodimers.},

We prove that replacing the usual quadratic regularizing penalties by weighted	Lp-penalties on the coefficients of such expansions, with 1 ≤ p ≤ 2, still regularizes the problem. Use of such Lp-penalized problems with p < 2 is often advocated when one expects the underlying ideal noiseless solution to have a sparse expansion with respect to the basis under consideration. To compute the corresponding regular- ized solutions, we analyze an iterative algorithm that amounts to a Landweber iteration with thresholding (or nonlinear shrinkage) applied at each iteration step.

@article{Milanese2004,
	Abstract = {In the paper the problem of identifying nonlinear dynamic systems, described in nonlinear regression form, is considered, using finite and noise-corrupted measurements. Most methods inthe literature are based onthe estimationof a model withina finitely parametrized model class describing the functional form of involved nonlinearities. A key problem in these methods is the proper choice of the model class, typically realized by a search, from the simplest to more complex ones (linear, bilinear, polynomial, neural networks, etc.). In this paper an alternative approach, based on a Set Membership framework is presented, not requiring assumptions on the functional form of the regression function describing the relations between measured input and output, but assuming only some information on its regularity, given by bounds on its gradient. In this way, the problem of considering approximate functional forms is circumvented. Moreover, noise is assumed to be bounded, in contrast with statistical methods, which rely on assumptions such as stationarity, ergodicity, uncorrelation, type of distribution, etc., whose validity may be difficult to test reliably and is lost in presence of approximate modeling. In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the validation of the considered assumptions. An optimal interval estimate of the regression function is obtained, providing its uncertainty range for any assigned regressor values. The set estimate allows to derive an optimal identi!cation
algorithm, giving estimates with minimal guaranteed Lp error onthe assigned domainof the regressors. The properties of the optimal estimate are investigated and its worst-case Lp identification error is evaluated. The presented approach is tested and compared with other nonlinear methods on the identi!cation of a water heater, a mechanical system with input saturation and a vehicle with controlled suspensions.},

	Abstract = {Here we address the problem of parameter estimation (inverse problem)of nonlinear dynamic biochemical pathways. This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP)problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},

	Abstract = {Many physical systems exhibiting nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics can be modeled by  partial differential equations. Although information about the physical properties for many of these systems is available, normally not all dynamical parameters are known and, therefore, have to be estimated from experimental data. We analyze two prominent approaches to solve this problem and describe advantages and disadvantages of both methods. Specifically, we focus on the dependence of the quality of the parameter estimates with respect to noise and temporal and spatial resolution of the measurements.},

	Abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a first- or second year undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers.

Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks.

Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single field, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

@article{Kanodia2009,
	Abstract = {The dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo depends on the nuclear localization gradient of Dorsal (Dl), a protein related to the mammalian NF-kB transcription factors. Current understanding of how the Dl gradient works has been derived from studies of its transcriptional interpretation, but the gradient itself has not been quantified. In particular, it is not known whether the Dl gradient is stable or dynamic during theDVpatterning of the embryo. To address this question, we developed a mathematical model of the Dl gradient and constrained its parameters by experimental data. Based on our computational analysis, we predict that the Dl gradient is dynamic and, to a first approximation, can be described as a concentration profile with increasing amplitude and constant shape. These timedependent properties of the Dl gradient are different from those of the Bicoid and MAPK phosphorylation gradients, which pattern the anterior and terminal regions of the embryo. Specifically, the gradient of the nuclear levels of Bicoid is stable, whereas the pattern of MAPK phosphorylation changes in both shape and amplitude. We attribute these striking differences in the dynamics of maternal morphogen gradients to the differences in the initial conditions and chemistries of the anterior, DV, and terminal systems.},

	Abstract = {Systems biology is a new discipline built upon the premise that an understanding of how cells and organisms carry out their functions cannot be gained by looking at cellular components in isolation. Instead, consideration of the interplay between the parts of systems is indispensable for analyzing, modeling, and predicting systems' behavior. Studying biological processes under this premise, systems biology combines experimental techniques and computational methods in order to construct predictive models. Both in building and utilizing models of biological systems, inverse problems arise at several occasions, for example, (i) when experimental time series and steady state data are used to construct biochemical reaction networks, (ii) when model parameters are identified that capture underlying mechanisms or (iii) when desired qualitative behavior such as bistability or limit cycle oscillations is engineered by proper choices of parameter combinations. In this paper we review principles of the modeling process in systems biology and illustrate the ill-posedness and regularization of parameter identification problems in that context. Furthermore, we discuss the methodology of qualitative inverse problems and demonstrate how sparsity enforcing regularization allows the determination of key reaction mechanisms underlying the qualitative behavior.},

First, when should bootstrap confidence intervals be used. Secondly, which method should be chosen, and thirdly, how should it be implemented. In order to do this, we review the common algorithms for resampling and methods for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals, together with some less well known ones, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We then present a simulation study, a #ow chart for choosing an appropriate method and a survival analysis example.},

@article{Tucker2006,
	Abstract = {As modern molecular biology moves towards the analysis of biological systems as opposed to their individual components, the need for appropriate mathematical and computational techniques for understanding the dynamics and structure of such systems is becoming more pressing. For example, the modeling of biochemical systems using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on high-throughput, time-dense profiles is becoming more common-place, which is necessitating the development of improved techniques to estimate model parameters from such data. Due to the high dimensionality of this estimation problem, straight-forward optimization strategies rarely produce correct parameter values, and hence current methods tend to utilize genetic/evolutionary algorithms to perform non-linear parameter fitting. Here, we describe a completely deterministic approach, which is based on interval analysis. This allows us to examine entire sets of parameters, and thus to exhaust the global search within a finite number of steps. In particular, we show how our method may be applied to a generic class of ODEs used for modeling biochemical systems called Generalized Mass ActionModels (GMAs). In addition, we show that for GMAs our method is amenable to the technique in interval arithmetic called constraint propagation, which allows great improvement of its efficiency. To illustrate the applicability of our method we apply it to some networks of biochemical reactions appearing in the literature, showing in particular that, in addition to estimating system parameters in the absence of noise, our method may also be used to recover the topology of these networks.},

	Abstract = {Typical scientific data is represented on a grid with appropriate interpolation or approximation schemes, defined on a continuous domain. The visualization of such data in parallel coordinates may reveal patterns latently contained in the data and thus can improve the understanding of multidimensional relations. In this paper, we adopt the concept of continuous scatterplots for the visualization of spatially continuous input data to derive a density model for parallel coordinates. Based on the point--line duality between scatterplots and parallel coordinates, we propose a mathematical model that maps density from a continuous scatterplot to parallel coordinates and present different algorithms for both numerical and analytical computation of the resulting density field. In addition, we show how the 2-D model can be used to successively construct continuous parallel coordinates with an arbitrary number of dimensions. Since continuous parallel coordinates interpolate data values within grid cells, a scalable and dense visualization is achieved, which will be demonstrated for typical multi-variate scientific data.},

	Abstract = {Analysis and safety considerations of chemical and biological processes frequently require an outer approximation of the set of all feasible steady-states. Nonlinearities, uncertain parameters, and discrete variables complicate the calculation of guaranteed outer bounds. In this paper, the problem of outer-approximating the region of feasible steady-states, for processes described by uncertain nonlinear differential algebraic equations including discrete variables and discrete changes in the dynamics, is adressed.

The calculation of the outer bounding sets is based on a relaxed version of the corresponding feasibility problem. It uses the Lagrange dual problem to obtain certificates for regions in state space not containing steady-states. These infeasibility certificates can be computed efficiently by solving a semidefinite program, rendering the calculation of the outer bounding set computationally feasible. The derived method guarantees globally valid outer bounds for the steady-states of nonlinear processes described by differential equations. It allows to consider discrete variables, as well as switching system dynamics.

The method is exemplified by the analysis of a simple chemical reactor showing parametric uncertainties and large variability due to the appearance of bifurcations characterising the ignition and extinction of a reaction.},

	Abstract = {Populations of heterogeneous cells play an important role in many biological systems. In this paper we consider systems where each cell can be modelled by an ordinary differential equation. To account for heterogeneity, parameter values are different among individual cells, subject to a distribution function which is part of the model specification.
	
Experimental data for heterogeneous cell populations can be obtained from flow cytometric fluorescence microscopy. We present a heuristic approach to use such data for estimation of the parameter distribution in the population. The approach is based on generating simulation data for samples in parameter space. By convex optimisation, a suitable probability density function for these samples is computed.

To evaluate the proposed approach, we consider artificial data from a simple model of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signalling pathway. Its main characteristic is a bimodality in the TNF response: a certain percentage of cells undergoes apoptosis upon stimulation, while the remaining part stays alive. We show how our modelling approach allows to identify the reasons that underly the differential response.},

Heterogeneity among individual cells is accounted for by differences in parameter values and initial conditions. Hereby, parameter values and initial conditions are subject to a distribution function which is part of the model specification. Based on the single cell model and the considered parameter distribution, a partial differential equation model describing the distribution of cells in the state and in the output space is derived. 

For the estimation of the parameter distribution within the model, we consider experimental data as obtained from flow cytometric analysis. From these noise-corrupted data a density-based statistical data model is derived. Employing this model of the data the parameter distribution within the cell population is computed using convex optimization techniques.

To evaluate the proposed method, a model for the caspase activation cascade is considered. It is shown that for known noise properties the unknown parameter distributions in this model are well estimated by the proposed method.},

The computational analysis of such situations requires the study of cell-cell variability and modeling of heterogeneous cell populations. In this work, we consider populations where the behavior of every single cell can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations. Heterogeneity among individual cells is modeled via differences in parameter values and initial conditions. Both are subject to a distribution function which is part of the cell population model.

We present a novel approach to estimate the distribution of parameters and initial conditions from single cell measurements, e.g. flow cytometry and cytometric fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, a maximum likelihood estimator for the distribution is derived. The resulting optimization problem is reformulated via a parameterization of the distribution of parameters and initial conditions to allow the use of convex optimization techniques.

To evaluate the proposed method, artificial data from a model of TNF signal transduction are considered. It is shown that the proposed method yields a good estimate of the parameter distributions in case of a limited amount of noise corrupted data.

	Abstract = {One of the most challenging tasks in systems biology is parameter identification from experimental data. In particular, if the available data are noisy, the resulting parameter uncertainty can be huge and should be quantified. In this work, a set-based approach for parameter identification in discrete time models of biochemical reaction networks from time series data is developed. The basic idea is to determine an outer approximation to the set of parameters for which trajectories are consistent with the available data. In order to approximate the set of consistent parameters (SCP) a feasibility problem is derived. This feasibility problem is used to verify that complete parameter sets cannot contain consistent parameters. This method is very appealing because instead of checking a finite number of distinct points, complete sets are analysed. With this approach, model falsification simply corresponds to showing that the SCP is empty. Besides parameter identification, a novel set-based method for experimental design is presented. This method yields reliable predictions on the information content of future measurements also for the case of very limited a priori knowledge and uncertain inputs. The properties of the method are presented using a discrete time model of the MAP kinase cascade.},

	Abstract = {A computer simulation technique used to evaluate the influence of several aspects of sampling designs on the efficiency of population pharmacokinetic parameter estimation is described. Although the simulations are restricted to the one-compartment one-exponential model, they provide the basis for a discussion of the structural aspects involved in designing a population study. These aspects include number of subjects required, number of samples per subject, and timing of these samples. Parameter estimates obtained from different sampling schedules based on two- and three-point designs are evaluated in terms of accuracy and precision. These simulated data sets include noise terms for both inter- and intraindividual variability. The results show that the population fixed-effect parameters (mean clearance and mean volume of distribution) for this simple pharmacokinetic model are efficiently estimated for most of the sampling schedules when two or three points are used, but the random-effect parameters (describing inter- and intraindividual variability) are inaccurate and imprecise for most of the sampling schedules when only two points are used. This drawback was remedied by increasing the number of data points per individual to three.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to approximate reachability computation for nonlinear continuous systems. Rather than studying a complex nonlinear system $\dot{x} = g(x)$, we study an approximating system $\dot{x} = f(x)$ which is easier to handle. The class of approximating systems we consider in this paper is piecewise linear, obtained by interpolating over a mesh. In order to be conservative, we add a bounded input in the approximating system to account for the interpolation error. We thus develop a reachability method for systems with input, based on the relation between such systems and the corresponding autonomous systems in terms of reachable sets. This method is then extended to the approximate piecewise linear systems arising in our construction. The final result is a reachability algorithm for nonlinear continuous systems which allows to compute conservative approximations with as great degree of accuracy as desired, and more importantly, it has good convergence rate. If g is a $C^2$ function, our method is of order 2. Furthermore, the method can be straightforwardly extended to hybrid systems.},

	Abstract = {Many biological systems have the capacity to operate in two distinct modes, in a stable manner. Typically, the system can switch from one stable mode to the other in response to a specific external input. Mathematically, these bistable systems are usually described by models that exhibit (at least) two distinct stable steady states. On the other hand, to capture biological variability, it seems more natural to associate to each stable mode of operation an appropriate invariant set in the state space rather than a single fixed point. A general formulation is proposed in this paper, which allows freedom in the form of kinetic interactions, and is suitable for establishing conditions on the existence of one or more disjoint forward-invariant sets for the given system. Stability with respect to each set is studied in terms of a local notion of input-to-state stability with respect to compact sets. Two well known systems that exhibit bistability are analyzed in this framework: the lac operon and an apoptosis network. For the first example, the question of designing an input that drives the system to switch between modes is also considered.},

	Abstract = {A single mouse click on the topic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in PubMed reveals about 50 000 articles providing one or the other information about this pleiotropic cytokine or its relatives. This demonstrates the enormous scientific and clinical interest in elucidating the biology of a molecule (or rather a large family of molecules), which began now almost 30 years ago with the description of a cytokine able to exert antitumoral effects in mouse models. Although our understanding of the multiple functions of TNF in vivo and of the respective underlying mechanisms at a cellular and molecular level has made enormous progress since then, new aspects are steadily uncovered and it appears that still much needs to be learned before we can conclude that we have a full comprehension of TNF biology. This review shortly covers some general aspects of this fascinating molecule and then concentrates on the molecular mechanisms of TNF signal transduction. In particular, the multiple facets of crosstalk between the various signalling pathways engaged by TNF will be addressed.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses important hybrid aspects of chemical processing plants. It is outlined that discrete phenomena occur both on the physical level and in the control of these plants. As the dynamics of the transformations of energy and material are predominantly continuous, large and complex hybrid systems arise. We focus on three different aspects of dealing with such systems: 1) Modeling and simulation of hybrid systems for the design and optimization of plants, controllers and operating strategies. We present powerful simulation environments that have been developed in recent years. 2) Validation of plant instrumentation and discrete controllers. These systems are largely responsible for the safe and economic operation of chemical plants and the protection of the workforce, and the environment. Techniques for the verification of discrete controllers for continuous processes are discussed, which are based on a discrete approximation of the continuous dynamics. 3) Scheduling of batch plants. For plants that are operated in a discontinuous fashion, the timing and sequencing of the operations are very important for the efficient use of the equipment. This leads to large mixed-integer optimization problems. For a typical example, we show how the process and the constraints can be modeled and describe an efficient solution algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear translocation of NF-kB initiates transcription of numerous genes, many of which are critical to host defense. Fluorescent image-based methods that quantify this event have historically utilized adherent cells with large cytoplasm-to-nuclear area ratios. However, many immunologically relevant cells are naturally non-adherent and have small cytoplasm-to-nuclear area ratios. Using the ImageStream imaging flow cytometer, we have developed a novel method that measures nuclear translocation in large populations using cross-correlation analysis of nuclear and NF-kB images from each cell. This approach accurately measures NF-kB translocation in cells with small cytoplasmic areas in dose- and time-dependent manners. Further, NF-kB translocation was accurately measured in a subset of cells contained in a mixed population and the technique was successfully employed to measure IRF-7 translocation in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) obtained from human peripheral blood. The techniques described here provide an objective and statistically robust method for measuring cytoplasmic to nuclear molecular translocation events in a variety of immunologically relevant cell types with characteristically low cytoplasm-to-nuclear area ratios.},

The main innovation of the method consists in the use of zonotopes for reachable set representation. Zonotopes are special polytopes with several interesting properties : they can be encoded efficiently, they are closed under linear transformations and Minkowski sum. The resulting method has been used to treat several examples and has shown great performances for high dimensional systems. An extension of the method for the verification of piecewise linear hybrid systems is proposed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of computing the reachable sets of hybrid systems with (possibly high dimensional) linear continuous dynamics and guards defined by switching hyperplanes. For the reachability analysis of the continuous dynamics, we use an efficient approximation algorithm based on zonotopes. In order to use this technique for the analysis of hybrid systems, we must also deal with the discrete transitions in a satisfactory (i.e. scalable and accurate) way. For that purpose, we need to approximate the intersection of the continuous reachable sets with the guards enabling the discrete transitions. The main contribution of this paper is a novel algorithm for computing efficiently a tight over-approximation of the intersection of (possibly high-order) zonotopes with a hyperplane. We show the accuracy and the scalability of our approach by considering two examples of reachability analysis of hybrid systems.},

	Abstract = {Modeling and control of hybrid systems, with particular emphasis on process control applications, are considered in this article. Based on a number of observations on typical mixed discrete and continuous features for such applications, a fairly general model structure for hybrid systems is proposed.

This model structure, which clearly separates the open-loop plant from the closed-loop system, is suitable for analysis and synthesis of hybrid control systems. To illustrate this, three different approaches for control-law synthesis based on continuous and discrete specifications are discussed. In the first one, the hybrid plant model is replaced by a purely discrete event model, related to the continuous specification, and a supervisor is synthesized applying supervisory control theory suggested by Wonham-Ramadge. The other two methods directly utilize the continuous specification for determination of a control event generator, where time-optimal aspects are introduced as an option in the last approach.},

Using a relaxed version of the corresponding feasibility problem and its Lagrangian dual, we show how to compute certificates for regions in state space not containing any steady states. Based on these results, we develop an algorithm to compute outer bounds for the region of all feasible steady states. We apply our algorithm to the sensitivity analysis of a Goldbeter--Koshland enzymatic cycle, which is a frequent motif in reaction networks for regulation of metabolism and signal transduction.},

	Abstract = {Background
Very frequently the same biological system is described by several, sometimes competing mathematical models. This usually creates confusion around their validity, ie, which one is correct. However, this is unnecessary since validity of a model cannot be established; model validation is actually a misnomer. In principle the only statement that one can make about a system model is that it is incorrect, ie, invalid, a fact which can be established given appropriate experimental data. Nonlinear models of high dimension and with many parameters are impossible to invalidate through simulation and as such the invalidation process is often overlooked or ignored.

Results
We develop different approaches for showing how competing ordinary differential equation (ODE) based models of the same biological phenomenon containing nonlinearities and parametric uncertainty can be invalidated using experimental data. We first emphasize the strong interplay between system identification and model invalidation and we describe a method for obtaining a lower bound on the error between candidate model predictions and data. We then turn to model invalidation and formulate a methodology for discrete-time and continuous-time model invalidation. The methodology is algorithmic and uses Semidefinite Programming as the computational tool. It is emphasized that trying to invalidate complex nonlinear models through exhaustive simulation is not only computationally intractable but also inconclusive.

Conclusion
Biological models derived from experimental data can never be validated. In fact, in order to understand biological function one should try to invalidate models that are incompatible with available data. This work describes a framework for invalidating both continuous and discrete-time ODE models based on convex optimization techniques. The methodology does not require any simulation of the candidate models; the algorithms presented in this paper have a worst case polynomial time complexity and can provide an exact answer to the invalidation problem.},

	Abstract = {Amiscellany of new strategies, experimental techniques and theoretical approaches are emerging in the ongoing battle against cancer. Nevertheless, as new, groundbreaking discoveries relating to many and diverse areas of cancer research are made, scientists often have recourse to mathematical modelling in order to elucidate and interpret these experimental findings. Indeed, experimentalists and clinicians alike are becoming increasingly aware of the possibilities afforded by mathematical modelling, recognising that current medical techniques and experimental approaches are often unable to distinguish between various possible mechanisms underlying important aspects of tumour development.

This short treatise presents a concise history of the study of solid tumour growth, illustrating the development of mathematical approaches from the early decades of the twentieth century to the present time. Most importantly these mathematical investigations are interwoven with the associated experimental work, showing the crucial relationship between experimental and theoretical approaches, which together have moulded our understanding of tumour growth and contributed to current anti-cancer treatments.

Thus, a selection of mathematical publications, including the influential theoretical studies by Burton, Greenspan, Liotta et al., McElwain and co-workers, Adam and Maggelakis, and Byrne and co-workers are juxtaposed with the seminal experimental findings of Gray et al. on oxygenation and radio-sensitivity, Folkman on angiogenesis, Dorie et al. on cell migration and a wide variety of other crucial discoveries. In this way the development of this field of research through the interactions of these different approaches is illuminated, demonstrating the origins of our current understanding of the disease.},

	Abstract = {The quality of experiments designed using standard optimisation-based techniques can be adversely affected by poor starting values of the parameters. Thus, there is a necessity for design methods that are insensitive (``robust'') to these starting values. Here, two novel, robust criteria are presented for computing optimal dynamic inputs for experiments aiming at improving parameter precision, based on previously proposed methods for providing design robustness --- the expected value criterion and the max--min criterion. In this paper, both criteria are extended by use of the information matrix derived for dynamic systems. The experiment design problem is cast as an optimal control problem, with experiment decision variables such as sampling times of response variables, time-varying and time-invariant external controls, experiment duration, and initial conditions. Comparisons are made of experiment designs obtained using the conventional approach and the newly proposed criteria. A typical semi-continuous bioreactor application is presented.},

	Abstract = {A prerequisite for well-posedness of parameter estimation of biological and physiological systems is a priori global identifiability, a property which concerns uniqueness of the solution for the unknown model parameters. Assessing a priori global identifiability is particularly difficult for nonlinear dynamic models. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature but no solution exists in the general case. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for testing global identifiability of nonlinear dynamic models, based on differential algebra. The characteristic set associated to the dynamic equations is calculated in an efficient way and computer algebra techniques are used to solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The algorithm is capable of handling many features arising in biological system models, including zero initial conditions and time-varying parameters. Examples of usage of the algorithm for analyzing a priori global identifiability of nonlinear models of biological and physiological systems are presented.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models of complex biological systems, such as metabolic or cell-signalling pathways, usually consist of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which depend on several non-measurable parameters that can be hopefully estimated by fitting the model to experimental data. However, the success of this fitting is largely conditioned by the quantity and quality of data. Optimal experimental design (OED) aims to design the scheme of actuations and measurements which will result in data sets with the maximum amount and/or quality of information for the subsequent model calibration. New methods and computational procedures for OED in the context of biological systems are presented. The OED problem is formulated as a general dynamic optimisation problem where the time-dependent stimuli profiles, the location of sampling times, the duration of the experiments and the initial conditions are regarded as design variables. Its solution is approached using the control vector parameterisation method. Since the resultant nonlinear optimisation problem is in most of the cases non-convex, the use of a robust global nonlinear programming solver is proposed. For the sake of comparing among different experimental schemes, a Monte-Carlo-based identifiability analysis is then suggested. The applicability and advantages of the proposed techniques are illustrated by considering an example related to a cell-signalling pathway.},

	Abstract = {Background: Modeling and simulation of cellular signaling and metabolic pathways as networks of biochemical reactions yields sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations. These models usually depend on several parameters and initial conditions. If these parameters are unknown, results from simulation studies can be misleading. Such a scenario can be avoided by fitting the model to experimental data before analyzing the system. This involves parameter estimation which is usually performed by minimizing a cost function which quantifies the difference between model predictions and measurements. Mathematically, this is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem which often results to be multi-modal (non-convex), rendering local optimization methods detrimental.

Results: In this work we propose a new hybrid global method, based on the combination of an evolutionary search strategy with a local multiple-shooting approach, which offers a reliable and efficient alternative for the solution of large scale parameter estimation problems.

Conclusion: The presented new hybrid strategy offers two main advantages over previous approaches: First, it is equipped with a switching strategy which allows the systematic determination of the transition from the local to global search. This avoids computationally expensive tests in advance. Second, using multiple-shooting as the local search procedure reduces the multi-modality of the non-linear optimization problem significantly. Because multiple-shooting avoids possible spurious solutions in the vicinity of the global optimum it often outperforms the frequently used initial value approach (single-shooting). Thereby, the use of multiple-shooting yields an enhanced robustness of the hybrid approach.},

	Abstract = {Thermal processing is widely used for ensuring food safety and extended shelf life. However, standard methods of thermal processing have a significant impact on food quality due to thermal degradation of nutrients and other quality factors. Model-based methods can be successfully used for thermal process design, optimization and control. However, building sound models requires suitable estimation of the unknown kinetic parameters. Further, the accuracy of these estimates will largely depend on the quality and quantity of the available experimental data.

Optimal experimental design (OED) of dynamic experiments allows for the calculation of the scheme of controls and measurements which improve the estimation of model parameters. In this contribution, the OED problem is formulated as a general dynamic optimization problem where the objective is to find those experimental conditions which result in maximum information content, as measured by the Fisher information matrix. The numerical solution of this problem is then approached using a combination of the control vector parameterization approach with a non-linear global optimization solver.

As an illustrative application, we consider the optimal experimental design for the parameter estimation of the thiamine degradation kinetic parameters during the thermal processing of canned tuna. Results confirm that the use of optimal dynamic experiments not only improves identifiability but also results in reduced confidence regions for the parameters (a maximum error of the 2% in the parameter estimates), substantially decreasing the experimental effort (up to a 50%). Particularly the use of six optimally designed experiments results in a 30% reduction of the confidence regions with respect to previously published results using 10 typical experiments.},

	Abstract = {The problem of optimal experimental design (OED) for parameter estimation of nonlinear dynamic systems is considered. It is shown how this problem can be formulated as a dynamic optimization (optimal control) problem where the performance index is usually a scalar function of the Fisher information matrix. Numerical solutions can be obtained using direct methods, which transform the original problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem via parametrizations. However, because of the frequent nonsmoothness of the cost functions, the use of gradient-based methods to solve this NLP might lead to local solutions. Stochastic methods of global optimization are suggested as robust alternatives. A case study considering the OED for parameter estimation in a fed-batch bioreactor is used to illustrate the performance and advantages of two selected stochastic algorithms.},

	Abstract = {System identification of treated tumor growth is addressed in this paper. Three main difficulties are examined: (i) the determination of a suited dynamical model structure (modeling problem), (ii) the inter-individual variability of the therapeutic responses(population identification problem or longitudinal data analysis) and (iii) the effects of some categorical factors on the model parameters. To solve these problems, a mixed effect model of tumor growth, a two step identification approach and an estimation algorithm based on expectation maximization, are proposed and applied to in vivo data. A double effect of treatments on the tumor volume responses is pointed out.},

@article{BellBur2009,
	Abstract = {Kalman--Bucy smoothers are often used to estimate the state variables as a function of time in a system with stochastic dynamics and measurement noise. This is accomplished using an algorithm for which the number of numerical operations grows linearly with the number of time points. All of the randomness in the model is assumed to be Gaussian. Including other available information, for example a bound on one of the state variables, is non trivial because it does not fit into the standard Kalman--Bucy smoother algorithm. In this paper we present an interior point method that maximizes the likelihood with respect to the sequence of state vectors satisfying inequality constraints. The method obtains the same decomposition that is normally obtained for the unconstrained Kalman--Bucy smoother, hence the resulting number of operations grows linearly with the number of time points. We present two algorithms, the first is for the affine case and the second is for the nonlinear case. Neither algorithm requires the optimization to start at a feasible sequence of state vector values. Both the unconstrained affine and unconstrained nonlinear Kalman--Bucy smoother are special cases of the class of problems that can be handled by these algorithms.},

@book{ConvexOptimization,
	Abstract = {This book is about convex optimization, a special class of mathematical optimization problems, which includes least-squares and linear programming problems. It is well known that least-squares and linear programming problems have a fairly complete theory, arise in a variety of applications, and can be solved numerically very efficiently. The basic point of this book is that the same can be said for the larger class of convex optimization problems.

While the mathematics of convex optimization has been studied for about a century, several related recent developments have stimulated new interest in the topic. The first is the recognition that interior-point methods, developed in the 1980s to solve linear programming problems, can be used to solve convex optimization problems as well. These new methods allow us to solve certain new classes of convex optimization problems, such as semidefinite programs and second-order cone programs, almost as easily as linear programs.

The second development is the discovery that convex optimization problems (beyond least-squares and linear programs) are more prevalent in practice than was previously thought. Since 1990 many applications have been discovered in areas such as automatic control systems, estimation and signal processing, communications and networks, electronic circuit design, data analysis and modeling, statistics, and finance. Convex optimization has also found wide application in combinatorial optimization and global optimization, where it is used to find bounds on the optimal value, as well as approximate solutions. We believe that many other applications of convex optimization are still waiting to be discovered.

There are great advantages to recognizing or formulating a problem as a convex optimization problem. The most basic advantage is that the problem can then be solved, very reliably and efficiently, using interior-point methods or other special methods for convex optimization. These solution methods are reliable enough to be embedded in a computer-aided design or analysis tool, or even a real-time reactive or automatic control system. There are also theoretical or conceptual advantages of formulating a problem as a convex optimization problem. The associated dual problem, for example, often has an interesting interpretation in terms of the original problem, and sometimes leads to an efficient or distributed method for solving it. We think that convex optimization is an important enough topic that everyone who uses computational mathematics should know at least a little bit about it. In our opinion, convex optimization is a natural next topic after advanced linear algebra (topics like least-squares, singular values), and linear programming.},

	Abstract = {We propose a very general framework that systematizes the notion of a hybrid system, combining differential equations and automata, governed by a hybrid controller that issues continuous-variable commands and makes logical decisions. We first identify the phenomena that arise in real-world hybrid systems. Then, we introduce a mathematical model of hybrid systems as interacting collections of dynamical systems, evolving on continuous-variable state spaces and subject to continuous controls and discrete transitions. The model captures the identified phenomena, subsumes previous models, yet retains enough structure to pose and solve meaningful control problems. We develop a theory for synthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in all optimal control framework. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of optimal (relaxed) and near-optimal (precise) controls and derive ?generalized quasi-variational inequalities? that the associated value function satisfies. We summarize algorithms for solving these inequalities based on a generalized Bellman equation, impulse control, and linear programming.},

	Abstract = {In this paper the problem of reliable and accurate parameter estimation for unstructured models is considered. It is illustrated how a theoretically optimal design can be successfully translated into a practically feasible, robust, and informative experiment. The well-known parameter estimation problem of Monod kinetic parameters is used as a vehicle to illustrate our approach. As known for a long time, noisy batch measurements do not allow for unique and accurate estimation of the kinetic parameters of the Monod model. Techniques of optimal experiment design are, therefore, exploited to design informative experiments and to improve the parameter estimation accuracy. During the design process, practical feasibility has to be kept in mind. The designed experiments are easy to implement in practice and do not require additional monitoring equipment. Both design and experimental validation of informative fed batch experiments are illustrated with a case study, namely, the growth of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria Azospirillum brasilense.},

	Abstract = {We apply the methods of optimal experimental design to a differential equation model for epidermal growth factor receptor signalling, trafficking and down-regulation. The model incorporates the role of a recently discovered protein complex made up of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl, the guanine exchange factor (GEF), Cool-1 (b-Pix) and the Rho family G protein Cdc42. The complex has been suggested to be important in disrupting receptor down-regulation. We demonstrate that the model interactions can accurately reproduce the experimental observations, that they can be used to make predictions with accompanying uncertainties, and that we can apply ideas of optimal experimental design to suggest new experiments that reduce the uncertainty on unmeasurable components of the system.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for determining optimally informative dynamic experiments for the purpose of model discrimination among several rival multiresponse nonlinear structured dynamic models generally described by systems of differential and algebraic equations (DAEs). A robust and efficient algorithm based on an extension to the dynamic case of the discrimination criterion put forth by Buzzi-Ferraris and Forzatti (Chem. Eng. Sci. 1984, 39, 81) is developed to calculate dynamic input trajectories by reformulation of the experiment design problem as an optimal control problem. We show that the new approach, by taking parametric uncertainty into account, can provide significant improvements in the ability to distinguish among a series of rival dynamic models over previous attempts to design dynamic experiments primarily based on parameter point estimates and thus maximizes the divergence of the model predictions without regard for uncertainty (Espie, D. M.; Macchietto, S. AIChE J. 1989, 35, 223). We illustrate the experiment design concepts with a relatively simple, but pedagogical example of the dynamic modeling of the fermentation of baker's yeast, although the methods are general enough to be applied in other modeling exercises.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a strategy for estimating the domain of attraction (DA) for non-polynomial systems via Lyapunov functions (LFs). The idea consists of converting the non-polynomial optimization arising for a chosen LF in a polynomial one, which can be solved via LMI optimizations. This is achieved by constructing an uncertain polynomial linearly affected by parameters constrained in a polytope which allows us to take into account the worst-case remainders in truncated Taylor expansions. Moreover, a condition is provided for ensuring asymptotical convergence to the largest estimate achievable with the chosen LF, and another condition is provided for establishing whether such an estimate has been found. The proposed strategy can readily be exploited with variable LFs in order to search for optimal estimates. Lastly, it is worth remarking that no other method is available to estimate the DA for non-polynomial systems via LMIs.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of determining the solution set of polynomial systems, a well-known problem in control system analysis and design. A novel approach is developed as a viable alternative to the commonly employed algebraic geometry and homotopy methods. The first result of the paper shows that the solution set of the polynomial system belongs to the kernel of a suitable symmetric matrix. Such a matrix is obtained via the solution of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) involving the maximization of the minimum eigenvalue of an affine family of symmetric matrices. The second result concerns the computation of the solution set from the kernel of the obtained matrix. For polynomial systems of degree m in n variables, a basic procedure is available if the kernel dimension does not exceed m + 1; while an extended procedure can be applied if the kernel dimension is less than n(m-1)+2: Finally, some application examples are illustrated to show the features of the approach and to make a brief comparison with polynomial resultant techniques.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling and dynamic simulation of signal transduction pathways is a central theme in systems biology and is increasingly attracting attention in the postgenomic era. The estimation of model parameters from experimental data remains a bottleneck for a major breakthrough in this area. This study's aim is to introduce a new strategy for experimental design based on parameter sensitivity analysis. The approach identifies key parameters/variables in a signal transduction pathway model and can thereby provide experimental biologists with guidance on which proteins to consider for measurement. The article focuses on applying this approach to the TNFa-mediated NF-kB pathway, which plays an important role in immunity and inflammation and in the control of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis. A mathematical model of this pathway is proposed, and the sensitivity analysis of model parameters is illustrated for this model by employing the Monte Carlo method over a broad range of parameter values.},

	Abstract = {Background:
Receptors and scaffold proteins possess a number of distinct domains and bind multiple partners. A common problem in modeling signaling systems arises from a combinatorial explosion of different states generated by feasible molecular species. The number of possible species grows exponentially with the number of different docking sites and can easily reach several millions. Models accounting for this combinatorial variety become impractical for many applications.

Results:
Our results show that under realistic assumptions on domain interactions, the dynamics of signaling pathways can be exactly described by reduced, hierarchically structured models. The method presented here provides a rigorous way to model a large class of signaling networks using macro-states (macroscopic quantities such as the levels of occupancy of the binding domains) instead of micro-states (concentrations of individual species). The method is described using generic multidomain proteins and is applied to the molecule LAT.

Conclusion:
The presented method is a systematic and powerful tool to derive reduced model structures describing the dynamics of multiprotein complex formation accurately.

	Abstract = {Previous work showed that the exponential growth phase of E. coli K12 MG1655, grown in Brain Heart Infusion broth at temperatures close to its maximum temperature for growth is disturbed. Based on plate count data, microscopic images and literature, the existence of a heat resistant subpopulation was hypothesized [21]. This hypothesis is here mathematically validated by means of a heterogeneous modeling approach. Two subpopulations are considered: one sensitive population and one population with increased heat tolerance. A large fraction of the initial population inactivates while the remaining smaller fraction is able to resist (or adapt to) the inimical temperature and grows. A heterogeneous model that encloses growth (resistant population) and inactivation (sensitive population) is used to describe the global population dynamics. Most experimental data can be predicted when taking into account parameter uncertainty via Monte Carlo simulation. The heterogeneous modeling approach yields accurate description of disturbed growth curves at super optimal temperatures, except for high initial cell densities. This study confirms the existence of a (small) heat resistant subpopulation in typical inoculum cultures of Escherichia coli K12 MG1655.},

	Abstract = {MATCONT is a graphical MATLAB software package for the interactive numerical study of dynamical systems. It allows one to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, period doubling bifurcation points of limit cycles, and fold bifurcation points of limit cycles. All curves are computed by the same function that implements a prediction-correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo-inverse. The continuation of bifurcation points of equilibria and limit cycles is based on bordering methods and minimally extended systems. Hence no additional unknowns such as singular vectors and eigenvectors are used and no artificial sparsity in the systems is created. The sparsity of the discretized systems for the computation of limit cycles and their bifurcation points is exploited by using the standard Matlab sparse matrix methods. The MATLAB environment makes the standard MATLAB Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Suite interactively available and provides computational and visualization tools; it also eliminates the compilation stage and so makes installation straightforward. Compared to other packages such as AUTO and CONTENT, adding a new type of curves is easy in the MATLAB environment. We illustrate this by a detailed description of the limit point curve type.},

	Abstract = {When building dynamic models from physical first-principles relations model structures occur that are often large-scale in their dimensions (due to spatial discretization of pde's)and include a high number of physically interpretable parameters. If subsequently the model parameters have to be identified from measurement data with prediction error methods (PEM) or (extended) Kalman filtering methods the question occurs whether the parameters are identifiable. The notion of identifiability refers -roughly speaking to the question whether parameter changes can be observed in the model output signal (output identifiability) or in the model's transfer function (structural identifiability).
The notion of output identifiability has been studied in e.g. Grewal and Glover [1976] and Ljung [1999]. The notion of structural identifiability was first stated by Bellman and {\AA}str{\"o}m [1970] and has been extensively studied in the field of compartmental modeling [Godfrey, 1983, Norton, 1980]. State-space model parameterizations have been analyzed},

Linearity of the integer (or discrete) variables, and convexity of the nonlinear functions involving continuous variables are the main features in the underlying mathematical structure. Based on principles of decomposition, outer-approximation and relaxation, the proposed algorithm effectively exploits the structure of the problems, and consists of solving an alternating finite sequence of nonlinear programming subproblems and relaxed versions of a mixed-integer linear master program. Convergence and optimality properties of the algorithm are presented, as well as a general discussion on its implementation. Numerical results are reported for several example problems to illustrate the potential of the proposed algorithm for programs in the class addressed in this paper. Finally, a theoretical comparison with generalized Benders decomposition is presented on the lower bounds predicted by the relaxed master programs.},

	Abstract = {Scatter search is a population-based method that has recently been shown to yield promising outcomes for solving combinatorial and nonlinear optimization problems. Based on formulations originally proposed in 1960s for combining decision rules and problem constraints such as the surrogate constraint method, scatter search uses strategies for combining solution vectors that have proved effective in a variety of problem settings. In this paper, we develop a general purpose heuristic for a class of nonlinear optimization problems. The procedure is based on the scatter search methodology and treats the objective function evaluation as a black box, making the search algorithm context-independent. Most optimization problems in the chemical and bio-chemical industries are highly nonlinear in either the objective function or the constraints. Moreover, they usually present differential-algebraic systems of constraints. In this type of problem, the evaluation of a solution or even the feasibility test of a set of values for the decision variables is a time-consuming operation. In this context, the solution method is limited to a reduced number of solution examinations. We have implemented a scatter search procedure in Matlab (Mathworks, 2004) for this special class of difficult optimization problems. Our development goes beyond a simple exercise of applying scatter search to this class of problems, but
presents innovativemechanisms to obtain a good balance between intensification and diversification in a short-term search horizon. Computational comparisons with other recent methods over a set of benchmark problems favor the proposed procedure.},

	Abstract = {This contribution provides an overview of our work on modelling biological processes focussing on the example of programmed cell death, also called apoptosis. Apoptosis is a molecular programme present in all cells of multi-cellular organisms. It is crucial during development and for cell homoeostasis in the adult. Misregulation is implicated in severe diseases. We review an ordinary differential equation model describing core processes of apoptosis signalling and the idea of viewing the life and death decision as a bistable system. Then, we show how small differences in model parameters can give rise to observed population heterogeneities. Employing a new conceptional modelling framework, we further show how a single model can describe a population and how stable steady states then translate into invariant sets employing a local notion of stability.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis is an important physiological process crucially involved in development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Although the major signaling pathways have been unraveled, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying network remains elusive. We have translated here the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the death-receptor-activated caspase cascade into a mathematical model. A reduction down to the apoptotic core machinery enables the application of analytical mathematical methods to evaluate the system behavior within a wide range of parameters. Using parameter values from the literature, the model reveals an unstable status of survival indicating the need for further control. Based on recent publications we tested one additional regulatory mechanism at the level of initiator caspase activation and demonstrated that the resulting system displays desired characteristics such as bistability. In addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population.},

	Abstract = {Different methods for analyzing the sensitivity of the direct signal transduction pathway of receptor-induced apoptosis to parameter changes are presented. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, removing unwanted cells within multicellular organisms to maintain a proper balance between cell reproduction and death. The results indicate the importance of controlling activated caspases by direct inhibition to prevent apoptosis. A misregulation of IAP molecules, one of the main inhibitors, appears to be especially critical. The results indicate how an increased production of this molecule might promote cancer progression, while a reduced degradation might not, thereby providing insight of potential pharmaceutical relevance and also stimulating experimental verification. Thus, the different engineering methods applied, nicely complement each other to provide valuable insight into this important process. Further, as for example IAPs are also an important connection to other signaling pathways, the results will enable a more efficient extension of the current model as we outline at the example of Tumor Necrosis Factor induced signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {Cellular events that execute life programs are ordered and reproducible, despite the noise and randomness underlying their biochemical reactions. The identification of the processes that ensure this robust operation is essential not only to uncover the salient design principles in organisms, but also to forward-engineer reliable genetic networks for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes. The use of feedback for noise reduction has been suggested as a recurring motif in genetic networks. In this work, we show that regulated degradation of proteins implements a negative feedback loop that enhances robustness against stochastic fluctuations and cellular noise. The analysis is carried out in the context of the bacterial heat shock response where the tight control of the amount of heat shock proteins is achieved through an intricate architecture of feedback loops involving the s32-factor. The s32 regulates the transcription of heat shock proteins under normal and stress conditions. An essential feature of the heat shock response is a feedback loop regulating the degradation of s32. We investigate the noiserejection properties of this loop, therefore illustrating our point in a biologically plausible example},

	differential equations.
	
	Included are complete treatments of the method of characteristics;
	energy methods within Sobolev spaces; regularity for second-order
	elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations; maximum principles;
	the multidimensional calculus of variations; viscosity solutions
	of Hamilton-Jacobi equations; shock waves and entropy criteria for
	conservation laws; and much more.
	
	The author summarizes the relevant mathematics required to understand
	current research in PDEs, especially nonlinear PDEs. While he has
	reworked and simplified much of the classical theory (particularly
	the method of characteristics), he emphasizes the modern interplay
	between functional analytic insights and calculus-type estimates
	within the context of Sobolev spaces. Treatment of all topics is
	complete and self-contained. The book's wide scope and clear exposition

	Abstract = {To obtain a systems-level understanding of a biological system, the authors conducted quantitative dynamic experiments from which the system structure and the parameters have to be deduced. Since biological systems have to cope with different environmental conditions, certain properties are often robust with respect to variations in some of the parameters. Hence, it is important to use optimal experimental design considerations in advance of the experiments to improve the information content of the measurements. Using the MAP--Kinase pathway as an example, the authors present a simulation study investigating the application of different optimality criteria. It is demonstrated that experimental design significantly improves the parameter estimation accuracy and also reveals difficulties in parameter estimation due to robustness.},

@article{Gonze2006,
	Abstract = {Circadian rhythms, characterized by a period of about 24 h, are the most widespread biological rhythms generated autonomously at the molecular level. The core molecular mechanism responsible for circadian oscillations relies on the negative regulation exerted by a protein on the expression of its own gene. Deterministic models account for the occurrence of autonomous circadian oscillations, for their entrainment by light-dark cycles, and for their phase shifting by light pulses. Stochastic versions of these models take into consideration the molecular fluctuations that arise when the number of molecules involved in the regulatory mechanism is low. Numerical simulations of the stochastic models show that robust circadian oscillations can already occur with a limited number of mRNA and protein molecules, in the range of a few tens and hundreds, respectively. Various factors affect the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to molecular noise. Besides an increase in the number of molecules, entrainment by light-dark cycles, and cooperativity in repression enhance robustness, whereas the proximity of a bifurcation point leads to less robust oscillations. Another parameter that appears to be crucial for the coherence of circadian rhythms is the binding/unbinding rate of the inhibitory protein to the promoter of the clock gene. Intercellular coupling further increases the robustness of circadian oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Cancers arise owing to mutations in a subset of genes that confer growth advantage. The availability of the human genome sequence led us to propose that systematic resequencing of cancer genomes for mutations would lead to the discovery of many additional cancer genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be `passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for `driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes therefore reveals the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a larger repertoire of cancer genes than previously anticipated.},

@article{GuttingerMor1999,
	Abstract = {G{\"u}ttinger and Morari (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1998, 38, 1633−1648) developed graphical methods for the prediction of output multiplicities caused by the reactive vapor−liquid equilibrium in reactive distillation. These methods rest upon the limiting case of reactive columns of infinite length operated at infinite internal flows (∞/∞ analysis) and are directly applicable to systems where the reactions take place in the entire column (``nonhybrid'' columns). In this work, the reactive ∞/∞ analysis is extended to columns with a reactive core (``hybrid'' columns) by introduction of two new procedures. First, necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions for hybrid column profiles are derived under the assumption that each of the reactive and nonreactive column sections has infinite length. Using these conditions, an ``exact'' method is formulated where all possible products of such an ∞/∞ hybrid column can be located in the composition space (by a continuation of solutions). The existence of multiple steady states and the feed region leading to output multiplicities can be predicted. Second, an ``approximate'' procedure is proposed to obtain an estimate of the product locations of a hybrid column with finite nonreactive sections. The exact method was applied to an ``ideal'' reactive system, and a new type of multiplicity, which is purely caused by the hybrid nature of the system, is shown. Moreover, the methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) reactive distillation process is analyzed using both methods, and the physical causes of the MTBE multiplicities are studied in detail. All analytical results are verified by simulation.},

The average value or the number distribution of any intracellular property captured by the individual cell model can be calculated by simulation of a sufficient number of individual cells. The proposed method is applied to a simple model of yeast glycolytic oscillations where synchronization of the cell population is mediated by the action of an excreted metabolite. We show that smooth one-dimensional distributions can be obtained with ensembles comprising 1000 individual cells. Random variations in the state and/or structure of individual cells are shown to produce complex dynamic behaviours which cannot be adequately captured by small ensembles.},

	Abstract = {Network reconstruction, i.e. obtaining network structure from input-output information, is a central theme in systems biology. A variety of approaches aim to obtaining structural information from available data. Previous work has introduced dynamical structure functions as a tool for posing and solving the network reconstruction problem. Even for linear time invariant systems, reconstruction requires specific additional information not generated in the typical system identification process. This paper demonstrates that such extra information can be obtained through a limited sequence of system identification experiments on structurally modified systems, analogous to gene silencing and overexpression experiments. In the absence of such extra information, we discuss whether combined assumptions of network sparsity and minimality contribute to the recovery of the network dynamical structure. We provide sufficient conditions for a transfer function to have a completely decoupled minimal realization, and demonstrate that every transfer function is arbitrarily close to one that admits a perfectly decoupled minimal realization. This indicates that the assumptions of sparsity and minimality alone do not lend insight into the network structure.},

The method is completely rigorous as it is based on validated integration of the vector field. As a consequence, no consistent parameters can be lost during the pruning phase. For data sets with moderate levels of noise, this yields a good reconstruction of the underlying parameters. Several examples are included to illustrate the merits of the method.},

	Abstract = {A quantitative description of dynamical systems requires the estimation of uncertain kinetic parameters and an analysis of their precision. A method frequently used to describe the confidence intervals of estimated parameters is based on the Fisher-Information-Matrix. The application of this traditional method has two important shortcomings: (i) it gives only lower bounds for the variance of a parameter if the solution of the underlying model equations is non-linear in parameters. (ii) The resulting confidence interval is symmetric with respect to the estimated parameter. Here, we show that by applying the bootstrap method a better approximation of (possibly) asymmetric confidence intervals for parameters could be obtained. In contrast to previous applications devoted to non-parametric problems, a dynamical model describing a bio-chemical network is used to evaluate the method.},

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, also known as Particle Filters, provide very good numerical approximations to the associated optimal state estimation problems. However, in many scenarios, the state-space model of interest also depends on unknown static parameters that need to be estimated from the data. In this context, standard SMC methods fail and it is necessary to rely on more sophisticated algorithms. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of SMC methods that have been proposed to perform static parameter estimation in general state-space models.

	Abstract = {Gene networks arise due to the interaction of genes through their protein products.Modeling such networks is key to understanding life at the most basic level. One of the emerging challenges to the analysis of genetic networks is that the cellular environment in which these genetic circuits function is abuzz with noise. The main source of this noise is the randomness that characterizes the motion of cellular constituents at the molecular level. Cellular noise not only results in random fluctuations (over time) within individual cells, but it is also a source of phenotypic variability among clonal cellular populations. In some instances fluctuations are suppressed downstream through an intricate dynamical network that facts as noise filters. Yet in other important instances, noise induced fluctuations are exploited to the cells advantage. The richness of stochastic phenomena in biology depends directly upon the interactions of dynamics and noise and upon the mechanisms through which these interactions occur. In this paper, we explore the origins and impact of cellular noise, drawing examples from endogenous and synthetic biological networks. We motivate the need for stochastic models and outline the key tools for the modeling and analysis of stochasticity inside living cells. We show that tools from system theory can be effectively utilized for modeling, analysis, and identifcation of genenetworks.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: A class of sigmoid functions designated generalized von Bertalanffy, Gompertzian and generalized Logistic has been used to fit tumour growth data. Various models have been proposed to explain the biological significance and foundations of these functions. However, no model has been found to fully explain all three or the relationships between them.
Materials and Methods: We propose a simple cancer cell population dynamics model that provides a biological interpretation for these sigmoids' ability to represent tumour growth.
Results and Conclusions: We show that the three sigmoids can be derived from the model and are in fact a single solution subject to the continuous variation of parameters describing the decay of the proliferation fraction and/or cell quiescence. We use the model to generate proliferation fraction profiles for each sigmoid and comment on the significance of the differences relative to cell cycle-specific and non-cell cycle-specific therapies.},

The growth of the organisms is described in a bioreactor in which one substrate is fed into the reactor with a given feed rate and feed concentration. Measurements for some intracellular components are provided representing a small biochemical network. Problems of reverse engineering, parameter estimation, and identifiability are addressed. The contribution mainly focuses on the problem of model discrimination. If two or more model variants describe the available experimental data, a new experiment must be designed to discriminate between the hypothetical models. For the problem presented, the feed rate and feed concentration of a bioreactor system are available as control inputs. To verify calculated input profiles an interactive Web site (http://www.sysbio.de/projects/benchmark/) is provided. Several solutions based on linear and nonlinear models are discussed.},

@article{KuepferSau2007,
	Abstract = {Background: Current approaches to parameter estimation are often inappropriate or inconvenient for the modelling of complex biological systems. For systems described by nonlinear equations, the conventional approach is to first numerically integrate the model, and then, in a second a posteriori step, check for consistency with experimental constraints. Hence, only single parameter sets can be considered at a time. Consequently, it is impossible to conclude that the "best" solution was identified or that no good solution exists, because parameter spaces typically cannot be explored in a reasonable amount of time.

Results: We introduce a novel approach based on semidefinite programming to directly identify consistent steady state concentrations for systems consisting of mass action kinetics, i.e., polynomial equations and inequality constraints. The duality properties of semidefinite programming allow to rigorously certify infeasibility for whole regions of parameter space, thus enabling the simultaneous multi-dimensional analysis of entire parameter sets.

Conclusion: Our algorithm reduces the computational effort of parameter estimation by several orders of magnitude, as illustrated through conceptual sample problems. Of particular relevance for systems biology, the approach can discriminate between structurally different candidate models by proving inconsistency with the available data.},

	Abstract = {It is difficult to model a distributed parameter system (DPS) due to the infinite-dimensional time/space nature and unknown nonlinear uncertainties. A low-dimensional and simple nonlinear model is often required for practical applications. In this paper, a spatio-temporal Volterra model is proposed with a series of spatio-temporal kernels for modeling unknown nonlinear DPS. To estimate these kernels, they are expanded onto spatial and temporal bases with unknown coefficients. To reduce the model dimension and parametric complexity in the spatial domain, the Karhunen--Lo{\`e}ve (KL) method is used to find the dominant spatial bases. To reduce the parametric complexity in the temporal domain, the Laguerre polynomials are selected as temporal bases. Next, using the Galerkin method, this spatio-temporal modeling becomes a linear regression problem. Then unknown parameters can be easily estimated using the least-squares method in the temporal domain. After the time/space synthesis, the spatio-temporal Volterra model can be constructed. The convergence of parameter estimation can be guaranteed under certain conditions. This model has a low-dimensional and simple nonlinear structure, which is useful for the prediction and control of the DPS. The simulation and experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method.},

	Abstract = {In this work we address the problem of the robust identification of unknown parameters of a cell population dynamics model from experimental data on the kinetics of cells labelled with a fluorescence marker defining the division age of the cell. The model is formulated by a first order hyperbolic PDE for the distri- bution of cells with respect to the structure variable x (or z) being the intensity level (or the log10-transformed intensity level) of the marker. The parameters of the model are the rate functions of cell division, death, label decay and the label dilution factor. We develop a computational approach to the identification of the model parameters with a particular focus on the cell birth rate α(z) as a function of the marker intensity, assuming the other model parameters are scalars to be estimated. To solve the inverse problem numerically, we parameterize α(z) and apply a maximum likelihood approach. The parametrization is based on cubic Hermite splines defined on a coarse mesh with either equally spaced a priori fixed nodes or nodes to be determined in the parameter estimation procedure. Ill-posedness of the inverse problem is indicated by multiple minima. To treat the ill-posed problem, we apply Tikhonov regularization with the regularization parameter determined by the discrepancy principle. We show that the solution of the regularized parameter estimation problem is consistent with the data set with an accuracy within the noise level in the measurements.},

	Abstract = {Background: The flow cytometry analysis of CFSE-labelled cells is currently one of the most informative experimental techniques for studying cell proliferation in immunology. The quantitative interpretation and understanding of such heterogenous cell population data requires the development of distributed parameter mathematical models and computational techniques for data assimilation.

Methods and Results: The mathematical modelling of label-structured cell population dynamics leads to a hyperbolic partial differential equation in one space variable. The model contains fundamental parameters of cell turnover and label dilution that need to be estimated from the flow cytometry data on the kinetics of the CFSE label distribution. To this end a maximum likelihood approach is used. The Lax-Wendroff method is used to solve the corresponding initial-boundary value problem for the model equation. By fitting two original experimental data sets with the model we show its biological consistency and potential for quantitative characterization of the cell division and death rates, treated as continuous functions of the CFSE expression level.

Conclusion: Once the initial distribution of the proliferating cell population with respect to the CFSE intensity is given, the distributed parameter modelling allows one to work directly with the histograms of the CFSE fluorescence without the need to specify the marker ranges. The labelstructured model and the elaborated computational approach establish a quantitative basis for more informative interpretation of the flow cytometry CFSE systems.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge in systems biology is to evaluate the feasibility of a biological research project prior to its realization. Since experiments are animals-, cost- and time-consuming, approaches allowing researchers to discriminate alternative hypotheses with a minimal set of experiments are highly desirable. Given a null hypothesis and alternative model, as well as laboratory constraints like observable players, sample size, noise level, and stimulation options, we suggest a method to obtain a list of required experiments in order to significantly reject the null hypothesis model M0 if a specified alternative model MA is realized. For this purpose, we estimate the power to detect a violation of M0 by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Iteratively, the power is maximized over all feasible stimulations of the system using multi-experiment fitting, leading to an optimal combination of experimental settings to discriminate the null hypothesis and alternativemodel.We prove the importance of simultaneous modeling of combined experiments with quantitative, highly sampled in vivo measurements from the Jak/STAT5 signaling pathway in fibroblasts, stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo). Afterwards we apply the presented iterative experimental design approach to the Jak/STAT3 pathway of primary hepatocytes stimulated with IL-6. Our approach offers the possibility of decidingwhich scientific questions can be answered based on existing laboratory constraints. To be able to concentrate on feasible questions on account of inexpensive computational simulations yields not only enormous cost and time saving, but also helps to specify realizable, systematic research projects in advance.

@article{Mantzaris2007,
	Abstract = {Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability or cell population heterogeneity originates from two fundamentally different sources: unequal partitioning of cellular material at cell division and stochastic fluctuations associated with intracellular reactions. We developed a mathematical and computational framework that can quantitatively isolate both heterogeneity sources and applied it to a genetic network with positive feedback architecture. The framework consists of three vastly different mathematical formulations: a), a continuum model, which completely neglects population heterogeneity; b), a deterministic cell population balance model, which accounts for population heterogeneity originating only from unequal partitioning at cell division; and c), a fully stochastic model accommodating both sources of population heterogeneity. The framework enables the quantitative decomposition of the effects of the different population heterogeneity sources on system behavior. Our results indicate the importance of cell population heterogeneity in accurately predicting even average population properties. Moreover, we find that unequal partitioning at cell division and sharp division rates shrink the region of the parameter space where the population exhibits bistable behavior, a characteristic feature of networks with positive feedback architecture. In addition, intrinsic noise at the single-cell level due to slow operator fluctuations and small numbers of molecules further contributes toward the shrinkage of the bistability regime at the cell population level. Finally, the effect of intrinsic noise at the cell population level was found to be markedly different than at the single-cell level, emphasizing the importance of simulating entire cell populations and not just individual cells to understand the complex interplay between single-cell genetic architecture and behavior at the cell population level.},

	Abstract = {This chapter concerns the use of convex optimization in real-time embedded systems, in areas such as signal processing, automatic control, real-time estimation, real-time resource allocation and decision making, and fast automated trading. By `embedded' we mean that the optimization algorithm is part of a larger, fully automated system, that executes automatically with newly arriving data or changing conditions, and without any human intervention or action. By `real-time' we mean that the optimization algorithm executes much faster than a typical or generic method with a human in the loop, in times measured in milliseconds or microseconds for small and medium size problems, and (a few) seconds for larger problems. In real-time embedded convex optimization the same optimization problem is solved many times, with different data, often with a hard real-time deadline. In this chapter we propose an automatic code generation system for real-time embedded convex optimization. Such a system scans a description of the problem family, and performs much of the analysis and optimization of the algorithm, such as choosing variable orderings used with sparse factorizations and determining storage structures, at code generation time. Compiling the generated source code yields an extremely efficient custom solver for the problem family. We describe a preliminary implementation, built on the Python-based modeling framework CVXMOD, and give some timing results for several examples.},

	Abstract = {The problem of making inference on nonlinear systems starting from finite and noise-corrupted data is considered. In particular, the inference of identification, prediction and filtering are treated. The inference making problem is approached by means of a Set Membership (SM) method. The main feature of this method is that it assumes a bound on the gradient of the model regression function. On the contrary, most of the existing methods need the choice of a functional form of the regression function. The search of the functional form may be quite time consuming, and lead only to approximate model structures, whose errors may be responsible of large inference errors. Moreover, the SM method assumes only that the noise is bounded, in contrast with statistical approaches, which rely on noise assumptions such as stationarity, ergodicity, uncorrelation, type of distribution, etc. The validity of these assumptions may be difficult to test in many applications and is certainly lost in presence of approximate modeling. In the paper, some of the main results developed by the authors, i.e. an optimal identification algorithm, two almost-optimal prediction algorithms and an almost-optimal filtering algorithm are presented within the presented unified SM inference making problem.},

	Abstract = {The cellular environment is abuzz with noise originating from the inherent random motion of reacting molecules in the living cell. In this noisy environment, clonal cell populations show cell-to-cell variability that can manifest significant phenotypic differences. Noise-induced stochastic fluctuations in cellular constituents can be measured and their statistics quantified. We show that these random fluctuations carry within them valuable information about the underlying genetic network. Far from being a nuisance, the ever-present cellular noise acts as a rich source of excitation that, when processed through a gene network, carries its distinctive fingerprint that encodes a wealth of information about that network. We show that in some cases the analysis of these random fluctuations enables the full identification of network parameters, including those that may otherwise be difficult to measure. This establishes a potentially powerful approach for the identification of gene networks and offers a new window into the workings of these networks.},

	Abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection FSP method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation CME. Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm SSA or  leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and $\tau$ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than $\tau$ leaping methods.},

	Abstract = {The field of control-oriented system identification is mature. Nevertheless, it is still very active. This is because there are many important unsolved challenges. Of these, this paper considers a selection. This involves considering the estimation of general nonlinear model structures, together with accurate error bounds, using methods that scale well to models of high dimension. A particular strength of the system identification field is that it has always actively sought to understand, embrace and develop ideas from other fields, such as statistics, mathematics and econometrics. This paper proposes a continuation of this successful strategy by proposing and profiling the adoption of new ideas originating in statistics, signal processing and statistical mechanics.},

	Abstract = {Structured nonlinear system identification is a block oriented identification method for systems that can be described by the interconnection of known linear dynamic systems and unknown static nonlinearities. An identification algorithmfor this class of systems was previously presented in Hsu et al. (2008), and the related input design problem was solved in Vincent et al. (2009) when there is no feedback from the nonlinear blocks. In the present paper, we propose a strategy, based on linear Internal Model Control (IMC), for the implementation of the input design on a general structure. The strategy relies on the design of an IMC controller which minimizes a bound on the tracking error, defined as the difference between desired and actual input to the static nonlinearities. An application related to input design for the identification of semi-active suspensions is presented.},

	Abstract = {The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway is one of themost
	important and intensively studied signalling pathways. It is at the
	heart of a molecular-signalling network that governs the growth,
	proliferation, differentiation and survival of many, if not all,
	cell types. It is de-regulated in various diseases, ranging from
	cancer to immunological, inflammatory and degenerative syndromes,
	and thus represents an important drug target. Over recent years,
	the computational or mathematical modelling of biological systems
	has become increasingly valuable, and there is nowa wide variety
	ofmathematical models of theMAPKpathway which have led to some novel
	insights and predictions as to how this system functions. In the
	present review we give an overview of the processes involved in modelling
	a biological system using the popular approach of ordinary differential
	equations. Focusing on the MAPK pathway, we introduce the features
	and functions of the pathway itself before comparing the available
	models and describing what new biological insights they have led
	to.},

Here we show that small beads coated uniformly with a protein that catalyses actin polymerization are initially surrounded by symmetrical clouds of actin filaments. This symmetry is broken spontaneously, after which the beads undergo directional motion. We have developed a stochastic theory, in which each actin filament is modelled as an elastic brownian ratchet, that quantitatively accounts for the observed emergent symmetry-breaking behaviour. Symmetry-breaking can only occur for polymers that have a significant subunit off-rate, such as the biopolymers actin and tubulin.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process: Genes are activated and inactivated by random association and dissociation events, transcription is typically rare, and many proteins are present in low numbers per cell. The last few years have seen an explosion in the stochastic modeling of these processes, predicting protein fluctuations in terms of the frequencies of the probabilistic events. Here I discuss commonalities between theoretical descriptions, focusing on a gene-mRNA-protein model that includes most published studies as special cases. I also show how expression bursts can be explained as simplistic time-averaging, and how generic approximations can allow for concrete interpretations without requiring concrete assumptions. Measures and nomenclature are discussed to some extent and the modeling literature is briefly reviewed.},

The algorithms we develop are computationally tractable and reduce to (generally nondifferentiable) convex feasibility problems or to linear programming problems.

The methods employ functions of state-parameter-time, termed barrier certificates, whose existence proves that a model and a feasible parameter set are inconsistent with some time-domain experimental data. A very large class of models can be treated within this framework; this includes differential-algebraic models, models with memoryless/dynamic uncertainties, and hybrid models. Construction of barrier certificates can be performed by convex optimization, utilizing recent results on the sum of squares decomposition of multivariate polynomials.},

@article{QuachBru2007,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Statistical inference of biological networks such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways and metabolic networks can contribute to build a picture of complex interactions that take place in the cell. However, biological systems considered as dynamical, non-linear and generally partially observed processes may be difficult to estimate even if the structure of interactions is given.
Results: Using the same approach as Sitz et al. proposed in another context, we derive non-linear state-space models from ODEs describing biological networks. In this framework, we apply Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) to the estimation of both parameters and hidden variables of non-linear state-space models. We instantiate the method on a transcriptional regulatory model based on Hill kinetics and a signaling pathway model based on mass action kinetics. We successfully use synthetic data and experimental data to test our approach.
Conclusion: This approach covers a large set of biological networks models and gives rise to simple and fast estimation algorithms. Moreover, the Bayesian tool used here directly provides uncertainty estimates on parameters and hidden states. Let us also emphasize that it can be coupled with structure inference methods used in Graphical Probabilistic Models.},

	Abstract = {Biochemical dynamics are often determined by series of single molecule events such as gene expression and reactions involving protein concentrations at nanomolar concentrations. Molecular fluctuations, consequently, may be of biological significance. For example, heterogeneity in clonal populations is believed to arise from molecular fluctuations in gene expression. A realistic description, therefore, requires a probabilistic description of the biochemical dynamics as deterministic descriptions cannot capture the inherent molecular fluctuations. The Gillespie algorithm @D. T. Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2350~1977 is a stochastic procedure for simulating chemical systems at low concentrations. A limitation of stochastic kinetic models is that they require detailed information about the chemical kinetics often unavailable in biological systems. Furthermore, the Gillespie algorithm is computationally intensive when there are many molecules and reaction events. In this article, we explore one approximation technique, well known in deterministic kinetics, for simplifying the stochastic model: the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA). We illustrate how the QSSA can be applied to the Gillespie algorithm. Using the QSSA, we derive stochastic Michaelis-Menten rate expressions for simple enzymatic reactions and illustrate how the QSSA is applied when modeling and simulating a simple genetic circuit.},

	Abstract = {Background: We consider the problem of parameter estimation (model calibration) in nonlinear dynamic models of biological systems. Due to the frequent ill-conditioning and multi-modality of many of these problems, traditional local methods usually fail (unless initialized with very good guesses of the parameter vector). In order to surmount these difficulties, global optimization (GO) methods have been suggested as robust alternatives. Currently, deterministic GO methods can not solve problems of realistic size within this class in reasonable computation times. In contrast, certain types of stochastic GO methods have shown promising results, although the computational cost remains large. Rodriguez-Fernandez and coworkers have presented hybrid stochasticdeterministic GO methods which could reduce computation time by one order of magnitude while guaranteeing robustness. Our goal here was to further reduce the computational effort without loosing robustness.
Results: We have developed a new procedure based on the scatter search methodology for nonlinear optimization of dynamic models of arbitrary (or even unknown) structure (i.e. black-box models). In this contribution, we describe and apply this novel metaheuristic, inspired by recent developments in the field of operations research, to a set of complex identification problems and we make a critical comparison with respect to the previous (above mentioned) successful methods.
Conclusion: Robust and efficient methods for parameter estimation are of key importance in systems biology and related areas. The new metaheuristic presented in this paper aims to ensure the proper solution of these problems by adopting a global optimization approach, while keeping the computational effort under reasonable values. This new metaheuristic was applied to a set of three challenging parameter estimation problems of nonlinear dynamic biological systems, outperforming very significantly all the methods previously used for these benchmark problems.},

@article{Schenkendorf2009,
	Abstract = {Using mathematical models for a quantitative description of dynamical systems requires the identification of uncertain parameters by minimising the difference between simulation and measurement. Owing to the measurement noise also, the estimated parameters possess an uncertainty expressed by their variances. To obtain highly predictive models, very precise parameters are needed. The optimal experimental design (OED) as a numerical optimisation method is used to reduce the parameter uncertainty by minimising the parameter variances iteratively. A frequently applied method to define a cost function for OED is based on the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. The application of this traditional method has at least two shortcomings for models that are nonlinear in their parameters: (i) it gives only a lower bound of the parameter variances and (ii) the bias of the estimator is neglected. Here, the authors show that by applying the sigma point (SP) method a better approximation of characteristic values of the parameter statistics can be obtained, which has a direct benefit on OED. An additional advantage of the SP method is that it can also be used to investigate the influence of the parameter uncertainties on the simulation results. The SP method is demonstrated for the example of a widely used biological model.},

	Abstract = {We describe a frequency domain technique for the analysis of intrinsic noise within negatively autoregulated gene circuits. This approach is based on the transfer function around the feedback loop (loop transmission) and the equivalent noise bandwidth of the system. The loop transmission, T, is shown to be a determining factor of the dynamics and the noise behavior of autoregulated gene circuits, and this T-based technique provides a simple and flexible method for the analysis of noise arising from any source within the gene circuit. We show that negative feedback not only reduces the variance of the noise in the protein concentration, but also shifts this noise to higher frequencies where it may have a negligible effect on the noise behavior of following gene circuits within a cascade. This predicted effect is demonstrated through the exact stochastic simulation of a two-gene cascade. The analysis elucidates important aspects of gene circuit structure that control functionality, and may provide some insights into selective pressures leading to this structure. The resulting analytical relationships have a simple form, making them especially useful as synthetic gene circuit design equations. With the exception of the linearization of Hill kinetics, this technique is general and may be applied to the analysis or design of networks of higher complexity. This utility is demonstrated through the exact stochastic simulation of an autoregulated two-gene cascade operating near instability.},

	Abstract = {Modern robust control synthesis techniques aim at providing robustness with respect to uncertainty in the form of both additive noise and plant perturbations. On the other hand, the most popular system identification methods assume that all uncertainty is in the form of additive noise. This has hampered the application of robust control methods to practical problems. This paper begins to address the gap between the models used in control synthesis and those obtained from identification experiments by considering the connection between uncertain models and data. The model validation problem addressed here is: given experimental data and a model with both additive noise and norm-bounded perturbations, is it possible that the model could produce the observed input-output data? This problem is studied for the standard ${H}_{\infty}$/$\mu$ framework models. A necessary condition for such a model to describe an experimental datum is obtained. Furthermore, for a large class of models, in the robust control framework, this condition is computable as the solution of a quadratic optimization problem.},

	Abstract = {In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

	Abstract = {Background
Identifying large gene regulatory networks is an important task, while the acquisition of data through perturbation experiments (e.g., gene switches, RNAi, heterozygotes) is expensive. It is thus desirable to use an identification method that effectively incorporates available prior knowledge -- such as sparse connectivity -- and that allows to design experiments such that maximal information is gained from each one.

Results
Our main contributions are twofold: a method for consistent inference of network structure is provided, incorporating prior knowledge about sparse connectivity. The algorithm is time efficient and robust to violations of model assumptions. Moreover, we show how to use it for optimal experimental design, reducing the number of required experiments substantially. We employ sparse linear models, and show how to perform full Bayesian inference for these. We not only estimate a single maximum likelihood network, but compute a posterior distribution over networks, using a novel variant of the expectation propagation method. The representation of uncertainty enables us to do effective experimental design in a standard statistical setting: experiments are selected such that the experiments are maximally informative.

Conclusion
Few methods have addressed the design issue so far. Compared to the most well-known one, our method is more transparent, and is shown to perform qualitatively superior. In the former, hard and unrealistic constraints have to be placed on the network structure for mere computational tractability, while such are not required in our method. We demonstrate reconstruction and optimal experimental design capabilities on tasks generated from realistic non-linear network simulators.},

	Abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a Monte Carlo implementation of the nonlinear recursive Bayesian estimator. The EnKF has become a dominant data assimilation method used extensively in meteorology and oceanography. The EnKF uses an ensemble or set of random samples to represent the probability density of the state. It is a suboptimal minimum variance filter, which differs from the particle filter by using the Kalman filter linear update to find the a posteriori ensemble using randomized measurements. In this paper, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) state estimation strategy is suggested. The minimum variance EnKF estimate then forms the suboptimal initiator to a Newton-Raphson solution of the MAP nonlinear least squares optimization. The optimization framework also allows the use of physically meaningful constraints on the MAP estimate. More broadly, simultaneous MAP estimation of a moving horizon or batch of states is considered, which can use the summary statistics of the EnKF ensemble to approximate the a priori probability density for the horizon. The suggested MAP approach can offer robustness to plant-model mismatch and poor initialization of the filter when compared to the standard EnKF formulation.},

	Abstract = {Structured nonlinear system identification is a block oriented identification method for systems that can be described by the interconnection of known linear dynamic systems and
unknown static nonlinearities. An identifcation algorithm for this class of systems was previously presented in Hsu et al. [2008]. In this paper, we solve the related experiment design problem. Specifically, an expression for the expected estimate variance is derived, and a method for manufacturing an input sequence that minimizes an upper bound on this variance is developed, which depends on the solution to a convex optimization problem. Features of the solution include parameterization of the expected estimate variance by the input distribution, and a graph-based method for input generation.},

	Abstract = {Rationale: Modern molecular biology is generating data of unprecedented quantity and quality. Particularly exciting for biochemical pathway modeling and proteomics are comprehensive, time-dense profiles of metabolites or proteins that are measurable, for instance, with mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance or protein kinase phosphorylation. These profiles contain a wealth of information about the structure and dynamics of the pathway or network from which the data were obtained. The retrieval of this information requires a combination of computational methods and mathematical models, which are typically represented as systems of ordinary differential equations.

Results: We show that, for the purpose of structure identification, the substitution of differentials with estimated slopes in non-linear network models reduces the coupled system of differential equations to several sets of decoupled algebraic equations, which can be processed efficiently in parallel or sequentially. The estimation of slopes for each time series of the metabolic or proteomic profile is accomplished with a `universal function' that is computed directly from the data by cross-validated training of an artificial neural network (ANN).

Conclusions: Without preprocessing, the inverse problem of determining structure from metabolic or proteomic profile data is challenging and computationally expensive. The combination of system decoupling and data fitting with universal functions simplifies this inverse problem very significantly. Examples show successful estimations and current limitations of the method.

@article{WalkerGeo2008,
	Abstract = {Background:
Most mathematical models of biochemical pathways consider either signalling events that take place within a single cell in isolation, or an 'average' cell which is considered to be representative of a cell population. Likewise, experimental measurements are often averaged over populations consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells. This approach ignores the fact that even within a genetically-homogeneous population, local conditions may influence cell signalling and result in phenotypic heterogeneity.
We have developed a multi-scale computational model that accounts for emergent heterogeneity arising from the influences of intercellular signalling on individual cells within a population. Our approach was to develop an ODE model of juxtacrine EGFR-ligand activation of the MAPK intracellular pathway and to couple this to an agent-based representation of individual cells in an expanding epithelial cell culture population. This multi-scale, multi-paradigm approach has enabled us to simulate Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation in a population of cells and to examine the consequences of interpretation at a single cell or population-based level using virtual assays.

Results:
A model consisting of a single pair of interacting agents predicted very different Erk activation (phosphorylation) profiles, depending on the formation rate and stability of intercellular contacts, with the slow formation of stable contacts resulting in low but sustained activation of Erk, and transient contacts resulting in a transient Erk signal. Extension of this model to a population consisting of hundreds to thousands of interacting virtual cells revealed that the activated Erk profile measured across the entire cell population was very different and may appear to contradict individual cell findings, reflecting heterogeneity in population density across the culture. This prediction was supported by immunolabelling of an epithelial cell population grown in vitro, which confirmed heterogeneity of Erk activation.

Conclusion:
These results illustrate that mean experimental data obtained from analysing entire cell populations is an oversimplification, and should not be extrapolated to deduce the signal:response paradigm of individual cells. This multi-scale, multi-paradigm approach to biological simulation provides an important conceptual tool in addressing how information may be integrated over multiple scales to predict the behaviour of a biological system.},

This transdisciplinary field brings together knowledge on the relationships between genetics, pathophysiology and pharmacology. Systems pharmacology aims to understand the actions and adverse effects of drugs by considering targets in the context of the biological networks in which they exist. Genome medicine forms the base on which systems pharmacology can develop. Experimental and computational approaches enable systems pharmacology to obtain holistic, mechanistic information on disease networks and drug responses, and to identify new drug targets and specific drug combinations. Network analyses of interactions involved in pathophysiology and drug response across various scales of organization, from molecular to organismal, will allow the integration of the systems-level understanding of drug action with genome medicine. The interface of the two fields will enable drug discovery for personalized medicine. Here we provide a perspective on the questions and approaches that drive the development of these new interrelated fields.},

	Abstract = {The biotechnological potential of facultative photosynthetic bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum has been shown in various fields. However, generally these processes are dependent on the input of light which so far complicates large-scale applications. The recent development of a new cultivation process which allows the maximal expression of photosynthetic genes under semi-aerobic dark conditions in common bioreactors, offers a new possibility for exploring this potential. In the present study we establish a second crucial precondition - the maximal obtainable cell number in a bioreactor-, in order to estimate the volumetric yields that can be expected in industrial applications. At this initial stage, we focus on aerobic growth since the highest growth rates are achieved under this condition. High-cell density cultures of R. rubrum could be used for the industrial production of hydrogen, polyhydroxyalkanoates, carotenoids and quinones, as a recombinant host for the expression of heterologous membrane proteins, or for the production of bacteriochlorophyll for photodynamic tumor therapy. Process control strategies were optimized by applying an unstructured model, which is based on mixed-substrate kinetics, for the growth on acetate or succinate, supplemented with fructose as a helper substrate to achieve higher growth rates. To avoid the accumulation of inhibiting substrates during the fed-batch cultivation, an exponential feeding strategy, combined with pH-stat was applied. The maximum cell density obtained with this strategy was ~ 55 g dry weight per liter. To our knowledge this cell concentration has never been reached before with this organism. A biochemical analysis of high-cell density cultures showed interesting differences to batch-cultures, such as a large accumulation of protoporphyrin IX.},

	Abstract = {Current approaches to parameter estimation and model invalidation are often inappropriate for biochemical reaction networks. This is because often only noisy measurements and sparse experimental data is available, and since they do not take the special structure of biochemical reaction networks into account. In this work a new method to prove model invalidity and to estimate parameters is introduced. It is based on a certificate of non-existence of feasible parameterizations for a given models. This is done by reformulating the model invalidation task into a set-based feasibility problem. As shown, due to the polynomial structure of many biochemical reaction systems, it is possible to relax the non-convex feasibility problem into a semidefinite program and thus to obtain conclusive results on model invalidity and parameter estimation. Our framework allows us to consider the arising difficulties posed by biochemical reaction networks by taking the specific structure of the dynamics and model outputs into account. It also enables us to discard large parameter regions as infeasible. We also show on a well-known biological example, namely the Michaelis-Menten and the Henri kinetics, how with this method it is possible to discriminate between model hypotheses and how to estimate parameters.},

@article{Waldherr2009a,
	Abstract = {Bifurcations leading to complex dynamical behaviour of non-linear systems are often encountered when the characteristics of feedback circuits in the system are varied. In systems with many unknown or varying parameters, it is an interesting, but difficult problem to find parameter values for which specific bifurcations occur. In this article, we develop a loop breaking approach to evaluate the influence of parameter values on feedback circuit characteristics. This approach allows a theoretical classification of feedback circuit characteristics related to possible bifurcations in the system. Based on the theoretical results, a numerical algorithm for bifurcation search in a possibly high-dimensional parameter space is developed. The application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by searching for a Hopf bifurcation in a model of the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade, which is a classical example for biochemical signal transduction.},
